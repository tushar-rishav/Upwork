General Development of Business
▪
General:
Altria Group, Inc. is a holding company incorporated in the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1985.  At
December 31, 2012
, Altria Group, Inc.'s direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries included Philip Morris USA Inc. ("PM USA"), which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and certain smokeless products in the United States; John Middleton Co. ("Middleton"), which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of machine-made large cigars and pipe tobacco, and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PM USA; and UST LLC ("UST"), which through its direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, including U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company LLC ("USSTC") and Ste. Michelle Wine Estates Ltd. ("Ste. Michelle"), is engaged in the manufacture and sale of smokeless products and wine.  Philip Morris Capital Corporation ("PMCC"), another wholly-owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc., maintains a portfolio of leveraged and direct finance leases.  In addition, Altria Group, Inc. held approximately 26.9% of the economic and voting interest of SABMiller plc ("SABMiller") at
December 31, 2012
, which Altria Group, Inc. accounts for under the equity method of accounting.
On January 6, 2009, Altria Group, Inc. acquired all of the outstanding common stock of UST.  The transaction was valued at approximately $11.7 billion, which represented a purchase price of $10.4 billion and approximately $1.3 billion of UST debt, which together with acquisition-related costs and payments of approximately $0.6 billion, represented a total cash outlay of approximately $11 billion.  This acquisition was financed with long-term borrowings.  As a result of the acquisition, UST became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc.
On March 28, 2008, Altria Group, Inc. distributed all of its interest in Philip Morris International Inc. ("PMI") to Altria Group, Inc. stockholders in a tax-free distribution.  Following the distribution of PMI, Altria Group, Inc. does not own any shares of PMI stock.  Altria Group, Inc. has reflected the results of PMI prior to the distribution as discontinued operations.  The PMI spin-off resulted in a net decrease to Altria Group, Inc.'s total stockholders' equity of $14.7 billion on the distribution date.  Following the PMI spin-off, Altria Group, Inc. lowered its dividend so that holders of both Altria Group, Inc. and PMI shares would receive initially, in the aggregate, the same dividends paid by Altria Group, Inc. prior to the PMI spin-off.
▪
Source of Funds:
Because Altria Group, Inc. is a holding company, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly-owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries.  At
December 31, 2012
, Altria Group, Inc.'s principal wholly-owned subsidiaries were not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their common stock.  In addition, Altria Group, Inc. receives cash
dividends on its interest in SABMiller, if and when SABMiller pays such dividends.
Financial Information About Segments
Altria Group, Inc.'s chief operating decision maker has been evaluating the operating results of the former cigarettes and cigars segments as a single smokeable products segment since January 1, 2012.  The combination of these two formerly separate segments is related to the restructuring associated with the cost reduction program announced in October 2011 (the "2011 Cost Reduction Program").  Also, in connection with the 2011 Cost Reduction Program, effective January 1, 2012, Middleton became a wholly-owned subsidiary of PM USA.  For further discussion on the 2011 Cost Reduction Program, see Note 4.
Asset Impairment, Exit, Implementation and Integration Costs
to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Item 8").
Effective with the first quarter of 2012, and at December 31, 2012, Altria Group, Inc.'s reportable segments were smokeable products, smokeless products, wine and financial services.  Net revenues and operating companies income (together with reconciliation to earnings before income taxes) attributable to each such segment for each of the last three years are set forth in Note 15.
Segment Reporting
to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 ("Note 15").
Altria Group, Inc.'s chief operating decision maker reviews operating companies income to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to the segments.  Operating companies income for the segments excludes general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles.  Interest and other debt expense, net (consumer products), and provision for income taxes are centrally managed at the corporate level and, accordingly, such items are not presented by segment since they are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by Altria Group, Inc.'s chief operating decision maker.  Information about total assets by segment is not disclosed because such information is not reported to or used by Altria Group, Inc.'s chief operating decision maker.  Segment goodwill and other intangible assets, net, are disclosed in Note 3.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net

Effective with the first quarter of 2013, Altria Group, Inc.'s reportable segments will be smokeable products, smokeless products and wine.  In connection with this revision, results of the financial services business and the alternative products business will be combined in an All Other category.  Altria Group, Inc. is making these changes due to the continued reduction of the lease portfolio of PMCC and the relative financial contribution of Altria Group, Inc.'s alternative products business to its consolidated results.  Altria Group, Inc. will begin reporting the All Other category and presenting comparable results for prior periods with its 2013 first-quarter results.
Narrative Description of Business
Portions of the information called for by this Item are included in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -
Operating Results by Business Segment
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Tobacco Space
Altria Group, Inc.'s tobacco operating companies include PM USA, USSTC and other subsidiaries of UST, and Middleton.  In addition, Altria Group Distribution Company provides centralized sales, distribution and consumer engagement services for Altria Group, Inc.'s tobacco operating companies.
The products of Altria Group, Inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries include smokeable products, comprised of cigarettes manufactured and sold by PM USA and machine-made large cigars and pipe tobacco manufactured and sold by Middleton; and smokeless products manufactured and sold by or on behalf of USSTC and PM USA.  Altria Group, Inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries believe that a significant number of adult tobacco consumers switch between tobacco categories or use multiple forms of tobacco products and that approximately 30% of adult smokers are interested in spit-free smokeless tobacco alternatives to cigarettes.
▪
Cigarettes:
PM USA is the largest cigarette company in the United States, with total cigarette shipment volume in the United States of approximately 134.9 billion units in 2012, a decrease of 0.2% from 2011.
Marlboro
, the principal cigarette brand of PM
USA, has been the largest-selling cigarette brand in the United States for over 35 years.
▪
Cigars:
Middleton is engaged in the manufacture and sale of machine-made large cigars and pipe tobacco to customers, substantially all of which are located in the United States.  Total shipment volume for cigars was approximately 1.2 billion units in 2012, a decrease of 0.7% from 2011.
Black & Mild
is the principal cigar brand of Middleton.
▪
Smokeless products:
USSTC is the leading producer and marketer of moist smokeless tobacco products.  The smokeless products segment includes the premium brands,
Copenhagen
and
Skoal
, value brands,
Red Seal
and
Husky,
and
Marlboro
Snus, a premium PM USA spit-free smokeless tobacco product.  Substantially all of the smokeless products are manufactured and sold to customers in the United States.  Total smokeless products shipment volume was 763.3 million units in 2012, an increase of 3.9% from 2011.
▪
Distribution, Competition and Raw Materials:
Altria Group, Inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries sell their tobacco products principally to wholesalers (including distributors), large retail organizations, including chain stores, and the armed services.
The market for tobacco products is highly competitive, characterized by brand recognition and loyalty, with product quality, taste, price, product innovation, marketing, packaging and distribution constituting the significant methods of competition.  Promotional activities include, in certain instances and where permitted by law, allowances, the distribution of incentive items, price promotions and other discounts, including coupons, product promotions and allowances for new products.
In June 2009, the President signed into law the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act ("FSPTCA"), which provides the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") with broad authority to regulate the design, manufacture, packaging, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of cigarettes, cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products; the authority to require disclosures of related information; and the authority to enforce the FSPTCA and related regulations.  The law also grants the FDA authority to extend its application, by regulation, to other tobacco products, including cigars.  The FSPTCA imposes significant new restrictions on the sale, advertising and promotion of tobacco products.  PM USA and a subsidiary of USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees as a result of this legislation, and the cost is being allocated based on the relative market shares of manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product.  PM USA, USSTC and other U.S. tobacco manufacturers have agreed to other marketing restrictions in the United States as part of the settlements of state health care cost recovery actions.
In the United States, under a contract growing program, PM USA purchases burley and flue-cured leaf tobaccos of various grades and styles directly from tobacco growers.  Under the terms of this program, PM USA agrees to purchase the amount of tobacco specified in the grower contracts.  PM USA also purchases a portion of its United States tobacco requirements
2
Table of Contents
through leaf merchants.  In 2003, PM USA and certain other defendants reached an agreement with plaintiffs to settle a suit filed on behalf of a purported class of tobacco growers and quota-holders. The agreement includes a commitment by each settling manufacturer defendant, including PM USA, to purchase a certain percentage of its leaf requirements from U.S. tobacco growers over a period of at least 10 years.  These quantities are subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement.
Tobacco production in the United States was historically subject to government controls, including the production control programs administered by the United States Department of Agriculture (the "USDA").  In October 2004, the Fair and Equitable Tobacco Reform Act of 2004 ("FETRA") was signed into law.  PM USA, USSTC, and Middleton are all subject to obligations imposed by FETRA.  FETRA eliminated the federal tobacco quota and price support program through an industry-funded buy-out of tobacco growers and quota holders.  The cost of the buy-out is approximately $9.5 billion and is being paid over 10 years by manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product.  The cost is being allocated based on the relative market shares of manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product.  As a result of FETRA, Altria Group, Inc.'s subsidiaries recorded approximately $0.4 billion of charges to cost of sales during each of the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.
In February 2011, PM USA filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging the USDA's method for calculating the 2011 and future tobacco product class shares that are used to allocate liability for the industry payments that fund the FETRA buy-out described above and used by the FDA to calculate the industry's FDA user fees.  PM USA asserts in this litigation that the USDA violated FETRA and its own regulations by failing to apply the most current federal excise tax ("FET") rates enacted by Congress which became effective in April 2009, in calculating the class share allocations.   PM USA has filed administrative appeals of its FETRA assessments beginning in fiscal year 2011 (all of which have been denied by the USDA) and has submitted a petition for rulemaking with the USDA (which petition was denied by the USDA in November 2011), in each case asserting that the USDA erroneously failed to base the FETRA class share allocations on the current FET rates.  PM USA is appealing the USDA's calculations methodology as well as the denial of the petition for rulemaking and the denial of its quarterly assessment challenges.  The Cigar Association of America has joined the litigation as a defendant intervenor.  In October 2012, the district court dismissed the case over PM USA's objection and the matter is now on appeal.
The quota buy-out did not have a material impact on Altria Group, Inc.'s
2012
consolidated results, and Altria Group, Inc. does not currently anticipate that the quota buy-out will have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results in 2013 and 2014, when the obligations imposed by FETRA will expire.
USSTC purchases burley, dark fire-cured and air-cured tobaccos of various grades and styles from domestic tobacco
growers under a contract growing program as well as from leaf merchants.
Middleton purchases burley and dark air-cured tobaccos of various grades and styles through leaf merchants.  Middleton does not have a contract growing program.
Altria Group, Inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries believe there is an adequate supply of tobacco in the world markets to satisfy their current and anticipated production requirements.
Wine
Altria Group, Inc. acquired UST and its premium wine business, Ste. Michelle, in January 2009.  Ste. Michelle is a producer of premium varietal and blended table wines.  Ste. Michelle is a leading producer of Washington state wines, primarily
Chateau Ste. Michelle
and
Columbia Crest
, and owns wineries in or distributes wines from several other wine
regions and foreign countries.  Ste. Michelle's total
2012
wine shipment volume of 7.6 million cases increased 3.7% from
2011
.
Ste. Michelle
holds an 85% ownership interest in Michelle-Antinori, LLC, which owns
Stag's Leap Wine Cellars
in Napa Valley.  Ste. Michelle also owns
Conn Creek
in Napa Valley and
Erath
in Oregon.  In addition, Ste. Michelle distributes
Antinori
and
Villa Maria Estate
wines and
Champagne Nicolas Feuillatte
in the United States.
▪
Distribution, Competition and Raw Materials:
Key elements of Ste. Michelle's strategy are expanded domestic distribution of its wines, especially in certain account categories such as restaurants, wholesale clubs, supermarkets, wine shops and mass merchandisers, and a focus on improving product mix to higher-priced, premium products.
Ste. Michelle's business is subject to significant competition, including competition from many larger, well-established domestic and international companies, as well as from many smaller wine producers.  Wine segment competition is primarily based on quality, price, consumer and trade wine tastings, competitive wine judging, third-party acclaim and advertising.  Substantially all of Ste. Michelle's sales occur through state-licensed distributors.
Federal, state and local governmental agencies regulate the alcohol beverage industry through various means, including licensing requirements, pricing, labeling and advertising restrictions, and distribution and production policies.  Further regulatory restrictions or additional excise or other taxes on the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages may have an adverse effect on Ste. Michelle's wine business.
Ste. Michelle uses grapes harvested from its own vineyards or purchased from independent growers, as well as bulk wine purchased from other sources.  Grape production can be adversely affected by weather and other forces that may limit production.  At the present time, Ste. Michelle believes that there is a sufficient supply of grapes and bulk wine available in the market to satisfy its current and expected production requirements.

Financial Services
In 2003, PMCC ceased making new investments and began focusing exclusively on managing its existing portfolio of finance assets in order to maximize gains and generate cash flow from asset sales and related activities.  Accordingly, PMCC's operating companies income will fluctuate over time as investments mature or are sold.
At
December 31, 2012
, PMCC's investments in finance leases were principally comprised of the following investment categories: aircraft (33%), rail and surface transport (24%), electric power (24%), real estate (13%) and manufacturing (6%).  There were no investments located outside the United States at December 31, 2012.

▪
Intellectual Property:
Trademarks are of material importance to Altria Group, Inc. and its operating companies, and are protected by registration or otherwise.  In addition, as of
December 31, 2012
, the portfolio of over 500 United States patents owned by Altria Group, Inc.'s businesses, as a whole, was material to Altria Group, Inc. and its tobacco businesses.  However, no one patent or group of related patents was material to Altria Group, Inc.'s business or its tobacco businesses as of
December 31, 2012
.  Altria Group, Inc.'s businesses also have proprietary secrets, technology, know-how, processes and other intellectual property rights that are protected by appropriate confidentiality measures.  Certain trade secrets are material to Altria Group, Inc. and its tobacco and wine businesses.
▪
Environmental Regulation:
Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (and former subsidiaries) are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise related to environmental protection, including, in the United States:  The Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known as "Superfund"), which can impose joint and several liability on each responsible party.  Subsidiaries (and former subsidiaries) of Altria Group, Inc. are involved in several matters subjecting them to potential costs of remediation and natural resource damages under Superfund or other laws and regulations.  Altria Group, Inc.'s subsidiaries expect to continue to make capital and other expenditures in connection with environmental laws and regulations.  As discussed in Note 2
,
Altria Group, Inc. provides for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated.  Such accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change.  Other than those amounts, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the cost of any environmental remediation and compliance efforts that subsidiaries of Altria Group, Inc. may undertake in the future.  In the opinion of management, however, compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including the payment of any remediation costs or damages and the making of related expenditures, has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on Altria Group, Inc.'s consolidated results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position or cash flows.
Financial Information About Geographic Areas
Substantially all of Altria Group, Inc.'s net revenues are from sales generated in the United States for each of the last three fiscal years and substantially all of Altria Group, Inc.'s long-lived assets are located in the United States.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors.
The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, our operating results, our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We* may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including earnings guidance and other statements contained in filings with the SEC, in reports to security holders and in press releases and investor webcasts.  You can identify these forward-looking statements by use of words such as "strategy," "expects," "continues," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "will," "estimates," "forecasts," "intends," "projects," "goals," "objectives," "guidance," "targets" and other words of similar meaning.  You can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.
We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions.  Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate.  Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected.  Investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in Altria Group, Inc.'s securities.  In connection with the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we are identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us; any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements. We elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document, particularly in the
Business Environment
sections preceding our discussion of operating results of our subsidiaries' businesses in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Item 7"). You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors.  Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.  We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that we may make from time to time except as required by applicable law.
Tobacco-Related Litigation
Legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending
or threatened in various United States and foreign jurisdictions against Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including PM USA and UST and its subsidiaries, as well as their respective indemnitees.  Various types of claims may be raised in these proceedings, including product liability, consumer protection, antitrust, tax, contraband shipments, patent infringement, employment matters, claims for contribution and claims of competitors and distributors.
Litigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending or future cases.  An unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco-related or other litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation.  Damages claimed in some tobacco-related or other litigation are significant and, in certain cases, range in the billions of dollars.  The variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions, together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims, demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome.  In certain cases, plaintiffs claim that defendants' liability is joint and several.  In such cases, Altria Group, Inc. or its subsidiaries may face the risk that one or more co-defendants decline or otherwise fail to participate in the bonding required for an appeal or to pay their proportionate or jury-allocated share of a judgment.  As a result, Altria Group, Inc. or its subsidiaries under certain circumstances may have to pay more than their proportionate share of any bonding- or judgment-related amounts.
Although PM USA has historically been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse verdicts have been appealed, there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases.  This risk has been substantially reduced given that 45 states and Puerto Rico now limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all.  As discussed in Note 18.
Contingencies
to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 ("Note 18"), tobacco litigation plaintiffs have challenged the constitutionality of Florida's bond cap statute in several cases and plaintiffs may challenge state bond cap statutes in other jurisdictions as well.  Such challenges may include the applicability of state bond caps in federal court.  Although we cannot predict the outcome of such challenges, it is possible that the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria Group, Inc., or one or more of its subsidiaries, could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome of one or more such challenges.

Table of Contents
In certain litigation, PM USA faces potentially significant non-monetary remedies.  For example, in the lawsuit brought by the United States Department of Justice, discussed in Note 18, the district court did not impose monetary penalties but ordered significant non-monetary remedies, including the issuance of "corrective statements" in various media.
Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries have achieved substantial success in managing litigation.  Nevertheless, litigation is subject to uncertainty and significant challenges remain.  It is possible that the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria Group, Inc., or one or more of its subsidiaries, could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation.  Altria Group, Inc. and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe, and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases, that it has valid defenses to the litigation pending against it, as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts.  Each of the companies has defended, and will continue to defend, vigorously against litigation challenges.  However, Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of Altria Group, Inc. to do so.  See Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Note 18 and Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of pending tobacco-related litigation.
Tobacco Regulation and Control Action in the Public and Private Sectors
Our tobacco subsidiaries face significant governmental action, including efforts aimed at reducing the incidence of tobacco use, restricting marketing and advertising, imposing regulations on packaging, warnings and disclosure of flavors or other ingredients, prohibiting the sale of tobacco products with certain characterizing flavors or other characteristics, premarket authorization of certain tobacco products, limiting or prohibiting the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments and the sale of tobacco products in certain packing sizes, and seeking to hold them responsible for the adverse health effects associated with both smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.
PM USA, USSTC and other Altria Group, Inc. subsidiaries are subject to regulation, and may become subject to additional regulation, by the FDA, as discussed in detail in
Tobacco Space - Business Environment - FSPTCA and FDA Regulation
in
Item 7.  We cannot predict how the FDA will implement and enforce its statutory authority, including by promulgating additional regulations and pursuing possible investigatory or enforcement actions.
Governmental actions, combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking, have resulted in reduced cigarette industry volume, and we expect that these factors will continue to reduce cigarette consumption levels.  Actions by the FDA or other federal, state or local governments or agencies may impact the consumer acceptability
of tobacco products, limit adult consumer choices, delay or prevent the launch of new or modified tobacco products, restrict communications to adult consumers, restrict the ability to differentiate tobacco products, create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain tobacco companies, impose additional manufacturing, labeling or packing requirements, require the recall or removal of tobacco products from the marketplace or otherwise significantly increase the cost of doing business, all or any of which may have a material adverse impact on the business, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria Group, Inc. and its tobacco subsidiaries.
Excise Taxes
Tobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes, and significant increases in tobacco product-related taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted within the United States at the state, federal and local levels.  Tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of our tobacco products due to lower consumption levels and to a potential shift in adult consumer purchases from the premium to the non-premium or discount segments or to other low-priced or low-taxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products.  Such shifts may have an adverse impact on the reported share performance of tobacco products of Altria Group, Inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries.  For further discussion, see
Tobacco Space - Business Environment - Excise Taxes
in Item 7
.
Increased Competition in the United States Tobacco Categories
Each of Altria Group, Inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries operates in highly competitive tobacco categories.  Settlements of certain tobacco litigation in the United States, among other factors, have resulted in substantial cigarette price increases.  PM USA faces competition from lowest priced brands sold by certain United States and foreign manufacturers that have cost advantages because they are not parties to these settlements.  These manufacturers may fail to comply with related state escrow legislation or may avoid escrow deposit obligations on the majority of their sales by concentrating on certain states where escrow deposits are not required or are required on fewer than all such manufacturers' cigarettes sold in such states.  Additional competition has resulted from diversion into the United States market of cigarettes intended for sale outside the United States, the sale of counterfeit cigarettes by third parties, the sale of cigarettes by third parties over the Internet and by other means designed to avoid collection of applicable taxes, and increased imports of foreign lowest priced brands.  USSTC faces significant competition in the smokeless tobacco category, both from existing competitors and new entrants, and has experienced consumer down-trading to lower-priced brands. In the cigar category, additional competition has resulted from increased imports of machine-made large cigars manufactured offshore.

New Product Technologies
Altria Group, Inc.'s subsidiaries continue to seek ways to develop and to commercialize new product technologies that may reduce the health risks associated with current tobacco products, while continuing to offer adult tobacco consumers (within and potentially outside the United States) products that meet their taste expectations and evolving preferences.  Potential solutions being researched include tobacco-containing and nicotine-containing products that reduce or eliminate exposure to cigarette smoke and/or constituents identified by public health authorities as harmful.  These efforts may include arrangements with third parties.  Moreover, these efforts may not succeed.  If our subsidiaries do not succeed in their efforts, but one or more of their competitors does, our subsidiaries may be at a competitive disadvantage.  Further, we cannot predict whether regulators, including the FDA, will permit the marketing or sale of such products with claims of reduced risk to consumers (or otherwise impose an unduly burdensome regulatory framework on such products) or whether consumers' purchase decisions would be affected by such claims, which could adversely affect the commercial viability of any such products that might be developed.
Adjacency Growth Strategy
Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries have adjacency growth strategies involving moves and potential moves into complementary products or processes.  We cannot guarantee that these strategies, or any products introduced in connection with these strategies, will be successful.  For a related discussion, see
New Product Technologies
above.
Tobacco Price, Availability and Quality
Any significant change in tobacco leaf prices, quality or availability could adversely affect our tobacco subsidiaries' profitability and business.  For a discussion of factors that influence leaf prices, availability and quality, see
Tobacco Space - Business Environment - Tobacco Price, Availability and Quality
in Item 7
.
Tobacco Key Facilities; Supply Security
Altria Group, Inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries face risks inherent in reliance on a few significant facilities and a small number of significant suppliers.  A natural or man-made disaster or other disruption that affects the manufacturing facilities of any of Altria Group, Inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries or the facilities of any significant suppliers of any of Altria Group, Inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries could adversely impact the operations of the affected subsidiaries.  An extended disruption in operations experienced by one or more Altria Group, Inc. subsidiaries or significant suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the business, the consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position of Altria Group, Inc.
Attracting and Retaining Talent
Our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining
the best talent may be impaired by the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage and tobacco regulation and control actions.  The tobacco industry competes for talent with the consumer products industry and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance.  As a result, we may be unable to attract and retain the best talent.
Competition, Evolving Consumer Preferences and Economic Downturns
Each of our tobacco and wine subsidiaries is subject to intense competition, changes in consumer preferences and changes in economic conditions.  To be successful, they must continue to:
▪
promote brand equity successfully;
▪
anticipate and respond to new and evolving consumer preferences;
▪
develop new products and markets within and potentially outside of the United States and broaden brand portfolios in order to compete effectively with lower-priced products;
▪
improve productivity; and
▪
protect or enhance margins through cost savings and price increases.
The willingness of adult consumers to purchase premium consumer product brands depends in part on economic conditions. In periods of economic uncertainty, adult consumers may purchase more discount brands and/or, in the case of tobacco products, consider lower-priced tobacco products.  The results of our tobacco and wine subsidiaries could suffer accordingly.
Our finance subsidiary, PMCC, holds investments in finance leases, principally in transportation (including aircraft), power generation and manufacturing equipment and facilities. Its lessees are also subject to intense competition and economic conditions. If parties to PMCC's leases fail to manage through difficult economic and competitive conditions, PMCC may have to increase its allowance for losses, which would adversely affect our earnings.
Acquisitions
Altria Group, Inc. from time to time considers acquisitions. From time to time, we may engage in confidential acquisition negotiations that are not publicly announced unless and until those negotiations result in a definitive agreement. Although we seek to maintain or improve our credit ratings over time, it is possible that completing a given acquisition or other event could impact our credit ratings or the outlook for those ratings.  Furthermore, acquisition opportunities are limited, and acquisitions present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration, strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms, that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or that acquisitions will be quickly accretive to earnings.

Capital Markets
Access to the capital markets is important for us to satisfy our liquidity and financing needs.  Disruption and uncertainty in the capital markets and any resulting tightening of credit availability, pricing and/or credit terms may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and may also increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate.
Exchange Rates
For purposes of financial reporting, the earnings of SABMiller are translated into U.S. dollars from various local currencies based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period.  During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar against these currencies, our reported equity earnings in SABMiller will be reduced because the local currencies will translate into fewer U.S. dollars.
Asset Impairment
We periodically calculate the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets to test for impairment.  This calculation may be affected by several factors, including general economic conditions, regulatory developments, changes in category growth rates as a result of changing consumer preferences, success of planned new product introductions, competitive activity and tobacco-related taxes.  If an impairment is determined to exist, we will incur impairment losses, which will reduce our earnings.  For further discussion, see
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
in Item 7
.
Wine - Competition; Grape Supply; Regulation and Excise Taxes
Ste. Michelle's business is subject to significant competition, including from many large, well-established domestic and international companies.  The adequacy of Ste. Michelle's grape supply is influenced by consumer demand for wine in relation to industry-wide production levels as well as by weather and crop conditions, particularly in eastern Washington.  Supply shortages related to any one or more of these factors could increase production costs and wine prices, which ultimately may have a negative impact on Ste. Michelle's sales. In addition, federal, state and local governmental agencies regulate the alcohol beverage industry through various means, including licensing requirements, pricing, labeling and advertising restrictions, and distribution and production policies.  New regulations or revisions to existing regulations, resulting in further restrictions or taxes on the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages, may have an adverse effect on Ste. Michelle's wine business.  For further discussion, see
Wine Segment - Business Environment
in Item 7
.
Information Systems
Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries use information systems to help manage business processes, collect and interpret business data and communicate internally and externally with employees, investors, suppliers, customers and others.  Many of these
information systems are managed by third-party service providers.  We have backup systems and business continuity plans in place and we take care to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access.  Nevertheless, failure of our systems to function as intended, or penetration of our systems by outside parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or otherwise disrupting business processes, could result in loss of revenue, assets or personal or other sensitive data, cause damage to the reputation of our companies and their brands and result in legal challenges and significant remediation and other costs to Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
Governmental Investigations
From time to time, Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters.  We cannot predict whether new investigations may be commenced or the outcome of such investigations, and it is possible that our subsidiaries' businesses could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of future investigations.

Item 2.  Properties.
The property in Richmond, Virginia that serves as the headquarters facility for Altria Group, Inc., PM USA, USSTC and Middleton and certain other subsidiaries is under lease.
At
December 31, 2012
, the smokeable products segment utilized four manufacturing and processing facilities.  PM USA owns and operates two tobacco manufacturing and processing facilities located in the Richmond, Virginia area that are utilized in the manufacturing and processing of cigarettes.  Middleton owns and operates two manufacturing and processing facilities - one in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania and one in Limerick, Pennsylvania - that are utilized in the manufacturing and processing of cigars and pipe tobacco.  In addition, PM USA  owns a research and technology center in Richmond, Virginia that is leased to an affiliate, Altria Client Services Inc.
At
December 31, 2012
, the smokeless products segment utilized four smokeless tobacco manufacturing and processing facilities located in Franklin Park, Illinois; Hopkinsville, Kentucky; Nashville, Tennessee; and Richmond, Virginia, all of which are owned and operated by a wholly-owned subsidiary of USSTC.
At
December 31, 2012
, the wine segment utilized 11 wine-making facilities - seven in Washington, three in California and one in Oregon.  All of these facilities are owned and operated by Ste. Michelle, with the exception of a facility that is leased by Ste. Michelle in Washington.  In addition, in order to support the production of its wines, the wine segment utilized vineyards in Washington, California and Oregon which are leased or owned by Ste. Michelle.
The plants and properties owned or leased and operated by Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries are maintained in good

condition and are believed to be suitable and adequate for present needs.
Item 3.  Legal Proceedings.
The information required by this Item is included in Note 18 and Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Altria Group, Inc.'s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the year ended December 31, 2012 were filed on Form 8-K on January 31, 2013 (such consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are also included in Item 8).   The following summarizes certain developments in Altria Group, Inc.'s litigation since the filing of such Form 8-K.
Recent Developments
Smoking and
Health Litigation
▪
Engle
Progeny Cases:
On January 31, 2013, in the
Kayton
(formerly
Tate
) case, PM USA filed a notice to invoke discretionary jurisdiction with the Florida Supreme Court.  Also, on January 31, 2013, in the
Hatziyannakis
case, PM USA filed a motion for a citation in order to facilitate further review of the case in the Florida Supreme Court.
In
Wilder
, a case pending in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida (Fort Myers), the jury returned a verdict in favor of PM USA on February 5, 2013.
On February 8, 2013 in the
Naugle
case, PM USA filed a notice to invoke the discretionary jurisdiction of the Florida Supreme Court.  Plaintiff also filed a notice on February 22, 2013 to invoke the discretionary jurisdiction of the Florida Supreme Court.
On February 13, 2013, the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal affirmed
per curiam
the trial court's decision in favor of the plaintiff in the
Weingart
case.
With respect to the federal
Engle
progeny cases, on February 13, 2013, the defendants filed a motion for reconsideration by the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida of its order directing the parties to engage in mediation to negotiate an aggregate settlement of all pending federal cases.
▪
Non-
Engle
Progeny Case (Alaska):
In the smoking and health case in Alaska in which a verdict was returned in favor of PM USA, the trial court withdrew on February 14, 2013 its prior order for a new trial upon PM USA's motion for reconsideration.  On February 25, 2013, the plaintiff filed a motion for the trial court to reconsider its February 14, 2013 ruling and reinstate its prior order.
Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation
▪
Other Disputes Related to Master Settlement Agreement ("MSA") Payments:
On February 14, 2013, an arbitration panel (which is a separate panel from the one in the pending non-participating manufacturer adjustment disputes discussed in Note 18) issued a ruling in favor of the MSA states in the dispute over the method of converting ounces of "roll your own" tobacco into individual cigarettes for purposes of calculating PM USA's and the other participating manufacturer's downward volume adjustments.  Consequently, PM USA will not receive any credit against its future MSA payments for the approximately $92 million in excess payments that PM USA believed it made in 2004 - 2012 as a result of this issue.
This same arbitration panel also issued a ruling in the dispute over whether the "adjusted gross" or the "net" number of cigarettes on which federal excise tax is paid is the correct methodology for calculating MSA payments due from certain subsequent participating manufacturers.  It is unclear precisely which past and future MSA payments may be affected by this ruling.  PM USA also does not currently have access to the data that would be necessary to determine the magnitude and the direction of such effects, if any.
▪
Federal Government's Lawsuit:
On February 15, 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit granted defendants' motion to hold their notice of appeal from the corrective statements order in abeyance.
"Lights/Ultra Lights" Cases
In the
Aspinall
case, on February 1, 2013, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, upon agreement of the parties, voluntarily dismissed Altria Group, Inc. without prejudice.  PM USA is now the sole defendant in the case.
In the
Carroll
case, on February 6, 2013, the trial court approved the parties' stipulation to the dismissal without prejudice of Altria Group, Inc. and PMI.  PM USA is now the sole defendant in the case.
In the
Price
case, on February 15, 2013, the Illinois Supreme Court denied PM USA's motion asking the Court to immediately exercise its jurisdiction over PM USA's appeal.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities During the Quarter Ended December 31, 2012
In October 2011, Altria Group, Inc.'s Board of Directors authorized a new $1.0 billion share repurchase program, which was expanded to $1.5 billion in October 2012 (the "October 2011 share repurchase program").  Altria Group, Inc. expects to complete the October 2011 share repurchase program by June 30, 2013.  The timing of share repurchases under the October 2011 share repurchase program depends on marketplace conditions and other factors, and the program remains subject to the discretion of Altria Group, Inc.'s Board of Directors.  Altria Group, Inc.'s share repurchase activity for each of the three months in the period ended December 31, 2012, was as follows:

Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8 and the discussion of cautionary factors that may affect future results in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Item 1A").
Description of the Company
At
December 31, 2012
, Altria Group, Inc.'s direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries included Philip Morris USA Inc. ("PM USA"), which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and certain smokeless products in the United States; John Middleton Co. ("Middleton"), which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of machine-made large cigars and pipe tobacco, and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PM USA; and UST LLC ("UST"), which through its direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries including U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company LLC ("USSTC") and Ste. Michelle Wine Estates Ltd. ("Ste. Michelle"), is engaged in the manufacture and sale of smokeless products and wine.  Philip Morris Capital Corporation ("PMCC"), another wholly-owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc., maintains a portfolio of leveraged and direct finance leases.  In addition, Altria Group, Inc. held approximately 26.9% of the economic and voting interest of SABMiller plc ("SABMiller") at
December 31, 2012
, which Altria Group, Inc. accounts for under the equity method of accounting.  Altria Group, Inc.'s access to the operating cash flows of its wholly-owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries.  In addition, Altria Group, Inc. receives cash dividends on its interest in SABMiller if and when SABMiller pays such dividends.  At
December 31, 2012
, Altria Group, Inc.'s principal wholly-owned subsidiaries were not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their common stock.
Altria Group, Inc.'s chief operating decision maker has been evaluating the operating results of the former cigarettes and cigars segments as a single smokeable products segment since January 1, 2012.  The combination of these two formerly separate segments is related to the restructuring associated with the cost reduction program announced in October 2011 (the "2011 Cost Reduction Program").  Also, in connection with the 2011 Cost Reduction Program, effective January 1, 2012, Middleton became a wholly-owned subsidiary of PM USA, reflecting management's goal to achieve efficiencies in the management of these businesses.  Effective with the first quarter of 2012 and at December 31, 2012, Altria Group, Inc.'s reportable segments were smokeable products, smokeless products, wine and financial services.   As a result of the revised reportable segments and Middleton becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of PM USA, certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with
the current year's presentation.  For further discussion on the 2011 Cost Reduction Program, see Note 4.
Asset Impairment, Exit, Implementation and Integration Costs
to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 ("Note 4").
Effective with the first quarter of 2013, Altria Group, Inc.'s reportable segments will be smokeable products, smokeless products and wine.  In connection with this revision, results of the financial services business and the alternative products business will be combined in an All Other category.  Altria Group, Inc. is making these changes due to the continued reduction of the lease portfolio of PMCC and the relative financial contribution of Altria Group, Inc.'s alternative products business to its consolidated results.  Altria Group, Inc. will begin reporting the All Other category and presenting comparable results for prior periods with its 2013 first-quarter results.
Executive Summary
The following executive summary is intended to provide significant highlights of the Discussion and Analysis that follows.

▪
Fewer Shares Outstanding:
Fewer shares outstanding during 2012 compared with 2011 were due primarily to shares repurchased by Altria Group, Inc. under its share repurchase programs.
▪
Change in Tax Rate:
The change in tax rate includes a reduction in certain consolidated tax benefits resulting from the 2012 debt tender offer.
▪
Operations:
The increase of
$380 million
in operations shown in the table above was due primarily to the following:
▪
higher income from all reportable segments;
▪
higher equity earnings from SABMiller; and
▪
lower interest and other debt expense, net.
For further details, see the Consolidated Operating Results and Operating Results by Business Segment sections of the following Discussion and Analysis.
2013 Forecasted Results
While there are signs of modest improvement in certain economic indicators, Altria Group, Inc. remains cautious about the 2013 business environment.  Adult consumers remain under economic pressure as they face the end of the payroll tax holiday, as well as continuing high unemployment.  With a number of states facing budget shortfalls, tobacco products will remain a target for excise tax increases.
In January 2013, Altria Group, Inc. forecasted that its 2013 full-year reported diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.34 to $2.40.  This forecast includes estimated expenses of $0.01 per share as detailed in the table below, as compared with 2012 full-year reported diluted EPS of $2.06, which included $0.15 per share of net expenses, as detailed in the table below.  Expected 2013 full-year adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes the expenses in the table below, represents a growth rate of 6% to 9% over 2012 full-year adjusted diluted EPS.  The 2013 full-year forecast does not reflect the potential impact of PM USA's agreement to resolve the Non-Participating Manufacturer ("NPM") adjustment disputes, discussed in Note 18.
Contingencies

Adjusted diluted EPS is a financial measure that is not consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP").  Altria Group, Inc.'s management reviews diluted EPS on an adjusted basis, which excludes certain income and expense items that management believes are not part of underlying operations.  These items include loss on early extinguishment of debt, restructuring charges, SABMiller special items, certain PMCC leveraged lease items, certain tax items and tobacco and health judgments.  Altria Group, Inc.'s management does not view any of these special items to be part of its sustainable results as they may be highly variable and difficult to predict and can distort underlying business trends and results.  Altria Group, Inc.'s management believes it is appropriate to disclose this non-GAAP financial measure to provide useful insight into underlying business trends and results, and to provide a more meaningful comparison of year-over-year results.  Adjusted measures are used by management and regularly provided to Altria Group, Inc.'s chief operating decision maker for planning, forecasting and evaluating the performances of Altria Group, Inc.'s businesses, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets.  This information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Discussion and Analysis
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Note 2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 ("Note 2") includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of Altria Group, Inc.'s consolidated financial statements.  In most instances, Altria Group, Inc. must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under U.S. GAAP.
The preparation of financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  If actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates, the revisions are included in Altria Group, Inc.'s consolidated results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known.  Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between Altria Group, Inc.'s estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
The following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates, as well as the accounting policies and methods, used in the preparation of Altria Group, Inc.'s consolidated financial statements:
▪
Consolidation:
The consolidated financial statements include Altria Group, Inc., as well as its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries.  Investments in which Altria
14
Table of Contents
Group, Inc. exercises significant influence are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
▪
Revenue Recognition:
The consumer products businesses recognize revenues, net of sales incentives and sales returns, and including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, upon shipment or delivery of goods when title and risk of loss pass to customers.  Payments received in advance of revenue recognition are deferred and recorded in other accrued liabilities until revenue is recognized.  Altria Group, Inc.'s consumer products businesses also include excise taxes billed to customers in net revenues.  Shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of sales.
▪
Depreciation, Amortization, Impairment Testing and Asset Valuation:
Altria Group, Inc. depreciates property, plant and equipment and amortizes its definite-lived intangible assets using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.  Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives up to 25 years.
Altria Group, Inc. reviews long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable.  Altria Group, Inc. performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists.  These analyses are affected by general economic conditions and projected growth rates.  For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, Altria Group, Inc. groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable.  If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value.  Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.  Altria Group, Inc. also reviews the estimated remaining useful lives of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the lives may have changed.
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded by Altria Group, Inc. at
December 31, 2012
relate primarily to the acquisitions of UST in 2009 and Middleton in 2007.  As required by U.S. GAAP, Altria Group, Inc. conducts an annual review of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would require Altria Group, Inc. to perform an interim review.
Goodwill impairment testing requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of each reporting unit.  If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, goodwill is considered impaired.  The amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill, which is determined using discounted cash flows.  Impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets requires a comparison between the fair value and carrying value of the intangible asset.  If the carrying value
exceeds fair value, the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value.
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, by reporting unit at

During
2012
,
2011
and
2010
, Altria Group, Inc. completed its annual review of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, and no impairment charges resulted from these reviews.
At
December 31, 2012
, the estimated fair values of the smokeless products and wine reporting units, as well as the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets within those reporting units, except for certain smokeless products trademarks (primarily
Red Seal
and
Husky
), substantially exceeded their carrying values.
At
December 31, 2012
, the estimated fair value of the cigars reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 13%.  In addition, the carrying value and excess fair value over carrying value for the indefinite-lived intangible assets of certain smokeless products and cigars trademarks were as follows:

In the smokeless products reporting unit, 2012 results for certain smokeless products trademarks, primarily
Red Seal
and
Husky
, continued to be impacted by lower levels of promotional support on these brands and increased competitive activity in the discount category due to growth in premium category products introduced in recent years at a lower, popular price.  This specific marketplace dynamic continued to negatively impact discounted cash flows when conducting the
2012
annual review of indefinite-lived intangible assets.  In the cigars reporting unit, Middleton continues to observe significant competitive activity, including higher levels of imported, low-priced machine-made large cigars.  As a result, management concluded after the 2012 review that while the fair values for certain smokeless products and cigars trademarks exceeded their respective carrying values (as indicated above), they do not substantially exceed their carrying values.
In 2012, Altria Group, Inc. utilized an income approach to estimate the fair value of its reporting units and its indefinite-lived intangible assets.  The income approach reflects the
15
Table of Contents
discounting of expected future cash flows to their present value at a rate of return that incorporates the risk-free rate for the use of those funds, the expected rate of inflation and the risks associated with realizing expected future cash flows.  The average discount rate utilized in performing the valuations was 10%.
In performing the 2012 discounted cash flow analysis, Altria Group, Inc. made various judgments, estimates and assumptions, the most significant of which were volume, income, growth rates and discount rates.  The analysis incorporated assumptions used in Altria Group, Inc.'s long-term financial forecast and also included market participant assumptions regarding the highest and best use of Altria Group, Inc.'s indefinite-lived intangible assets.  Assumptions are also made for perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term financial forecast.  Fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions, some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of Altria Group, Inc.'s control.
Although Altria Group, Inc.'s discounted cash flow analysis is based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information at the time that the discounted cash flow analysis is developed, there is significant judgment used in determining future cash flows.  The following factors have the most potential to impact expected future cash flows and, therefore, Altria Group, Inc.'s impairment conclusions:  general economic conditions; federal, state and local regulatory developments; changes in category growth rates as a result of changing consumer preferences; success of planned new product introductions; competitive activity; and tobacco-related taxes.
While Altria Group, Inc.'s management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset are reasonable, actual performance in the short-term or long-term could be significantly different from forecasted performance, which could result in impairment charges in future periods.

▪
Marketing Costs:
Altria Group, Inc.'s consumer products businesses promote their products with consumer engagement programs, consumer incentives and trade promotions.  Such programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives, event marketing and volume-based incentives.  Consumer engagement programs are expensed as incurred.  Consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction of revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period, based principally on historical utilization and redemption rates.  For interim reporting purposes, consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.
▪
Contingencies:
As discussed in Note 18 and Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Item 3"), legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various United States and foreign jurisdictions against Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including PM USA and UST and its subsidiaries, as well as their respective indemnitees.  In 1998, PM USA and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers entered into the Master Settlement Agreement (the "MSA") with 46 states and various other governments and jurisdictions to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims.  PM USA and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers had previously settled similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota (together with the MSA, the "State Settlement Agreements").   PM USA's portion of ongoing adjusted payments and legal fees is based on its relative share of the settling manufacturers' domestic cigarette shipments, including roll-your-own cigarettes, in the year preceding that in which the payment is due.  PM USA also entered into a trust agreement to provide certain aid to U.S. tobacco growers and quota holders, but PM USA's obligations under this trust expired on December 15, 2010 (these obligations had been offset by the obligations imposed on PM USA by the Fair and Equitable Tobacco Reform Act of 2004 ("FETRA"), which expires in the third quarter of 2014).  USSTC and Middleton are also subject to obligations imposed by FETRA.  In addition, in June 2009, PM USA and a subsidiary of USSTC became subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") as a result of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act ("FSPTCA").  The State Settlement Agreements, FETRA and the FDA user fees call for payments that are based on variable factors, such as volume, market share and inflation, depending on the subject payment.  Altria Group, Inc.'s subsidiaries account for the cost of the State Settlement Agreements, FETRA and FDA user fees as a component of cost of sales.  As a result of the State Settlement Agreements, FETRA and FDA user fees, Altria Group, Inc.'s subsidiaries recorded approximately $5.1 billion, $5.0 billion and $5.0 billion of charges to cost of sales for the years ended
December 31, 2012
,
2011
and
2010
, respectively.  See Note 18 for a discussion of the potential impact of PM USA's agreement to resolve the NPM adjustment disputes.
Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when they determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  Except to the extent discussed in Note 18 and Item 3, at the present time, while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, (i) management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobacco-related cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in any of the pending tobacco-related cases; and (iii) accordingly, management has not provided any
16
Table of Contents
amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes, if any.  Litigation defense costs are expensed as incurred and are included in marketing, administration and research costs on the consolidated statements of earnings.
▪
Employee Benefit Plans:
As discussed in Note 16.
Benefit Plans
to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 ("Note 16"), Altria Group, Inc. provides a range of benefits to its employees and retired employees, including pensions, postretirement health care and postemployment benefits (primarily severance).  Altria Group, Inc. records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by U.S. GAAP, which include various actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates.  Altria Group, Inc. reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so.  Any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods.
Altria Group, Inc. recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet and records as a component of other comprehensive earnings (losses), net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost.
At
December 31, 2012
, Altria Group, Inc.'s discount rate assumptions for its pension and postretirement plans decreased to 4.0% and 3.9%, respectively, from 5.0% and 4.9%, respectively, at
December 31, 2011
.  Altria Group, Inc. presently anticipates a decrease of approximately $18 million in its 2013 pre-tax pension and postretirement expense, not including amounts in each year related to termination, settlement and curtailment.  This anticipated decrease is due primarily to higher expected return on pension plan assets due to the higher value of plan assets at December 31, 2012 and the impact of a $350 million voluntary pension plan contribution made in January 2013, partially offset by the impact of the discount rate changes.  A 50 basis point decrease (increase) in Altria Group, Inc.'s discount rates would increase (decrease) Altria Group, Inc.'s pension and postretirement expense by approximately $39 million.  Similarly, a 50 basis point decrease (increase) in the expected return on plan assets would increase (decrease) Altria Group, Inc.'s pension expense by approximately $29 million.  See Note 16 for a sensitivity discussion of the assumed health care cost trend rates.
▪
Income Taxes:
Altria Group, Inc.'s deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions.
Altria Group, Inc. recognizes a benefit for uncertain tax positions when a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities.  The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
Altria Group, Inc. recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes on its consolidated statements of earnings.
As discussed in Note 14.
Income Taxes
to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 ("Note 14"), Altria Group, Inc. recognized income tax benefits and charges in the consolidated statements of earnings during
2012
,
2011
and
2010
as a result of various tax events.
▪
Leasing:
Substantially all of PMCC's net revenues in
2012
related to income on leveraged leases and related gains on asset sales.  Income relating to leveraged leases is recorded initially as unearned income, which is included in the line item finance assets, net, on Altria Group, Inc.'s consolidated balance sheets, and is subsequently recognized as revenue over the terms of the respective leases at constant after-tax rates of return on the positive net investment balances.  As discussed in Note 7.
Finance Assets, net
to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 ("Note 7"), PMCC lessees are affected by bankruptcy filings, credit rating changes and financial market conditions.
PMCC's investment in leases is included in the line item finance assets, net, on the consolidated balance sheets as of
December 31, 2012
and
2011
.  At
December 31, 2012
, PMCC's net finance receivables of approximately $2.5 billion in leveraged leases, which are included in finance assets, net, on Altria Group, Inc.'s consolidated balance sheet, consisted of rents receivable ($6.3 billion) and the residual value of assets under lease ($1.1 billion), reduced by third-party nonrecourse debt ($3.9 billion) and unearned income ($1.0 billion).  The repayment of the nonrecourse debt is collateralized by lease payments receivable and the leased property, and is nonrecourse to the general assets of PMCC.  As required by U.S. GAAP, the third-party nonrecourse debt has been offset against the related rents receivable and has been presented on a net basis within finance assets, net, on Altria Group, Inc.'s consolidated balance sheets.  Finance assets, net, at
December 31, 2012
, also included net finance receivables for direct finance leases ($0.2 billion) and an allowance for losses ($0.1 billion).
Estimated residual values represent PMCC's estimate at lease inception as to the fair values of assets under lease at the end of the non-cancelable lease terms.  The estimated residual values are reviewed annually by PMCC's management, which includes analysis of a number of factors, including activity in the relevant industry.  If necessary, revisions are recorded to reduce the residual values.  Such reviews resulted in a decrease of $8 million in 2012 and $11 million in 2010 to PMCC’s net revenues and results of operations.  There were no adjustments in 2011.
PMCC considers rents receivable past due when they are beyond the grace period of their contractual due date.  PMCC
17
Table of Contents
stops recording income ("non-accrual status") on rents receivable when contractual payments become 90 days past due or earlier if management believes there is significant uncertainty of collectability of rent payments, and resumes recording income when collectability of rent payments is reasonably certain.  Payments received on rents receivable that are on non-accrual status are used to reduce the rents receivable balance.  Write-offs to the allowance for losses are recorded when amounts are deemed to be uncollectible.  There were no rents receivable on non-accrual status at
December 31, 2012
.
To the extent that rents receivable due to PMCC may be uncollectible, PMCC records an allowance for losses against its finance assets.  Losses on such leases are recorded when probable and estimable.  PMCC regularly performs a systematic assessment of each individual lease in its portfolio to determine potential credit or collection issues that might indicate impairment.  Impairment takes into consideration both the probability of default and the likelihood of recovery if default were to occur.  PMCC considers both quantitative and qualitative factors of each investment when performing its assessment of the allowance for losses.  For further discussion, see Note 7.

Segment Reporting
to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Altria Group, Inc.'s chief operating decision maker reviews operating companies
income to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to the segments.  Operating companies income for the segments is defined as operating income before amortization of intangibles and general corporate expenses.  Management believes it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze the business performance and trends of the various business segments.

volume declines.  Total pre-tax charges, net, which have been substantially completed, incurred since the inception of this program were $271 million.  Altria Group, Inc. believes that the program remains on track to deliver $400 million in annualized savings versus previously planned spending by the end of 2013.
Altria Group, Inc. had a severance liability balance of $37 million at
December 31, 2012
related to the 2011 Cost Reduction Program, substantially all of which is expected to be paid out by June 30, 2013.

SABMiller Special Items:
Altria Group, Inc.'s earnings from its equity investment in SABMiller for
2012
included gains resulting from SABMiller's strategic alliance transactions with Anadolu Efes and Castel, partially offset by costs for SABMiller's "business capability programme" and costs related to SABMiller's acquisition of Foster's Group Limited ("Foster's").  Altria Group, Inc.'s earnings from its equity investment in SABMiller for 2011 included costs for SABMiller's "business capability programme," acquisition-related costs for SABMiller's acquisition of Foster's and asset impairment charges, partially offset by gains resulting from SABMiller's hotel and gaming transaction and the disposal of a business in Kenya.  Altria Group, Inc.'s earnings from its equity investment in SABMiller for 2010 included costs for SABMiller's "business capability programme" and costs related to SABMiller's economic and social development program in South Africa.
▪
PMCC Leveraged Lease Benefit/Charge:
During the second quarter of 2012, Altria Group, Inc. entered into a closing agreement (the "Closing Agreement") with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") that conclusively resolved the federal income tax treatment for all prior and future tax years of certain leveraged lease transactions entered into by PMCC.  As a result of the Closing Agreement, Altria Group, Inc. recorded a one-time net earnings benefit of $68 million during the second quarter of 2012 due primarily to lower than estimated interest on tax underpayments.  During the second quarter of 2011, Altria Group, Inc. recorded a charge of $627 million related to the federal income tax treatment of these transactions (the "2011 PMCC Leveraged Lease Charge").  Approximately 50% of the charge ($315 million) represented a reduction in cumulative lease earnings recorded as of the date of the charge that will be recaptured over the remainder of the terms of the affected leases.  The remaining portion of the charge ($312 million) primarily represented a permanent charge for interest on tax underpayments.
For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, the benefit/charge associated with PMCC's leveraged lease transactions was recorded in Altria Group, Inc.'s consolidated statements of earnings as follows:

PMCC Recoveries and Allowance for Losses:
During 2012, PMCC recorded pre-tax income of $34 million primarily related to recoveries from the sale of bankruptcy claims on, as well as the sale of aircraft under, its leases to American Airlines, Inc. ("American"), which filed for bankruptcy on November 29, 2011.  In addition, during 2012, PMCC decreased its allowance for losses by $10 million, which was recorded as an increase to operating companies income.  During 2011, PMCC increased its allowance for losses by $25 million, which was recorded as a decrease to operating companies income.  For further discussion, see Note 7.

Tax Items:
Excluding the tax impact included in the PMCC leveraged lease benefit, tax items for 2012 included the reversal of tax reserves and associated interest due primarily to the closure in 2012 of the IRS audit of Altria Group, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries' 2004 - 2006 tax years.  Tax items for 2011, excluding the tax impact included in the 2011 PMCC Leveraged Lease Charge, included the reversal of tax reserves and associated interest related to the expiration of statutes of limitations, closure of tax audits and the reversal of tax accruals no longer required.  Tax items for 2010 included the reversal of tax reserves and associated interest related to federal and several state audits, and the expiration of statutes of limitations.

2012 Compared With 2011
The following discussion compares consolidated operating results for the year ended
December 31, 2012
, with the year ended
December 31, 2011
.
Net revenues, which include excise taxes billed to customers, increased $818 million (3.4%), due to higher net revenues from the financial services (which included the 2011 PMCC Leveraged Lease Charge), smokeable products, smokeless products and wine segments.
Excise taxes on products decreased $63 million (0.9%), due primarily to lower excise taxes for Middleton and lower smokeable products shipment volume.
Cost of sales increased $257 million (3.3%), due primarily to higher per unit settlement charges and higher manufacturing costs.
Marketing, administration and research costs decreased $362 million (13.7%), primarily reflecting cost reduction initiatives, lower charges related to tobacco and health judgments, and recoveries related to American and a decrease to the allowance for losses in the financial services segment.
Operating income increased $1,185 million (19.5%), due primarily to: (i) higher operating results from the financial
services segment, which in 2011 included the 2011 PMCC Leveraged Lease Charge; (ii) higher operating results from the smokeable products and smokeless products segments, which included lower charges in 2012 related to the 2011 Cost Reduction Program and lower charges in the smokeable products segment related to tobacco and health judgments; and (iii) higher increases to Kraft Foods Inc. (now known as Mondelēz International, Inc. ("Mondelēz")) and Philip Morris International Inc. ("PMI") tax-related receivables.  As discussed in Note 14, changes to Mondelēz and PMI tax-related receivables were fully offset by a corresponding provision for income taxes associated with Mondelēz and PMI.
Interest and other debt expense, net, decreased $90 million (7.4%) due primarily to lower interest costs in 2012 related to tobacco and health judgments, and lower interest costs on debt as a result of debt refinancing activities in 2012.
Earnings from Altria Group, Inc.'s equity investment in SABMiller increased $494 million (67.7%), due primarily to higher net gains in 2012 for SABMiller special items (which included gains resulting from SABMiller's strategic alliance transactions with Anadolu Efes and Castel in 2012) and higher ongoing equity earnings.
Altria Group, Inc.'s effective income tax rate decreased 3.8 percentage points to 35.4% due primarily to a $312 million charge in 2011 that primarily represents interest on tax underpayments associated with the 2011 PMCC Leveraged Lease Charge, and a $73 million interest benefit recorded during 2012, resulting primarily from lower than estimated interest on tax underpayments related to the Closing Agreement with the IRS, partially offset by a reduction in certain consolidated tax benefits resulting from the 2012 debt tender offer and a higher tax provision in 2012 related to the Mondelēz and PMI tax matters discussed above.
Net earnings attributable to Altria Group, Inc. of $4,180 million increased $790 million (23.3%), due primarily to higher operating income, higher earnings from Altria Group, Inc.'s equity investment in SABMiller, a lower income tax rate and lower interest and other debt expense, net, partially offset by the loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the 2012 debt tender offer.  Diluted and basic EPS attributable to Altria Group, Inc. of $2.06, each increased by 25.6% due to higher net earnings attributable to Altria Group, Inc. and fewer shares outstanding.
2011 Compared With 2010
The following discussion compares consolidated operating results for the year ended
December 31, 2011
, with the year ended
December 31, 2010

Table of Contents
Cost of sales decreased $24 million (0.3%), due primarily to lower smokeable products shipment volume and 2010 implementation costs, partially offset by higher per unit settlement charges, higher FDA user fees and higher manufacturing costs.
Marketing, administration and research costs decreased $92 million (3.4%), primarily reflecting cost reduction initiatives and lower integration costs, partially offset by higher charges in 2011 related to tobacco and health judgments (See Note 18 and Item 3), higher general corporate expenses and an increase to the allowance for losses in the financial services segment.
Operating income decreased $160 million (2.6%), due primarily to lower operating results from the financial services segment (reflecting the impact to net revenues associated with the 2011 PMCC Leveraged Lease Charge) and higher general corporate expenses, partially offset by higher operating results from the smokeable products, smokeless products and wine segments (which included higher asset impairment and exit costs and higher charges related to tobacco and health judgments in the smokeable products segment, and higher asset impairment and exit costs in the smokeless products segment), and a reduction to the Mondelēz and PMI tax-related receivables in 2010.  As discussed in Note 14, changes to Mondelēz and PMI tax-related receivables were fully offset by a corresponding provision/benefit for income taxes associated with Mondelēz and PMI.
Interest and other debt expense, net, increased $83 million (7.3%), as a result of higher interest costs in 2011 related to tobacco and health judgments, and the issuance of senior unsecured long-term notes in May 2011, partially offset by debt refinancing activities in 2010.
Earnings from Altria Group, Inc.'s equity investment in SABMiller increased $102 million (16.2%), due primarily to higher ongoing equity earnings and higher net charges in 2010 for SABMiller special items, partially offset by lower gains in 2011 resulting from issuances of common stock by SABMiller.
Altria Group, Inc.'s effective income tax rate increased 7.5 percentage points to 39.2%, due primarily to a $312 million charge that primarily represents a permanent charge for interest on tax underpayments associated with the 2011 PMCC Leveraged Lease Charge and higher reversals of tax reserves and associated interest in 2010 principally related to certain Mondelēz and PMI tax matters discussed above.
Net earnings attributable to Altria Group, Inc. of $3,390 million decreased $515 million (13.2%), due primarily to lower operating income, higher interest and other debt expense, net, and a higher income tax rate, partially offset by higher earnings from Altria Group, Inc.'s equity investment in SABMiller.  Diluted and basic EPS attributable to Altria Group, Inc. of $1.64, each decreased by 12.3%.
Operating Results by Business Segment
Tobacco Space
Business Environment
Summary
The United States tobacco industry faces a number of business and legal challenges that have adversely affected and may adversely affect the business and sales volume of our tobacco subsidiaries and our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position. These challenges, some of which are discussed in more detail below, and in Note 18, Item 1A and Item 3, include:
▪
pending and threatened litigation and bonding requirements as discussed in Note 18 and Item 3;
▪
restrictions and requirements imposed by the FSPTCA enacted in June 2009, and restrictions and requirements that have been, and in the future may be, imposed by the FDA under this statute;
▪
actual and proposed excise tax increases, as well as changes in tax structures and tax stamping requirements;
▪
bans and restrictions on tobacco use imposed by governmental entities and private establishments and employers;
▪
other federal, state and local government actions, including:
▪
restrictions on the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments, the sale of certain tobacco products with certain characterizing flavors and the sale of tobacco products in certain package sizes;
▪
additional restrictions on the advertising and promotion of tobacco products;
▪
other actual and proposed tobacco product legislation and regulation; and
▪
governmental investigations;
▪
the diminishing prevalence of cigarette smoking and increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and others (including employers) to further restrict tobacco use;
▪
price gaps and changes in price gaps between premium and lowest price brands;
▪
competitive disadvantages related to cigarette price increases attributable to the settlement of certain litigation;
▪
illicit trade practices, including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products by third parties; the sale of tobacco products by third parties over the Internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes; diversion into one market of products intended for sale in another; the potential assertion of claims and other issues relating to contraband shipments of tobacco products; and the
21
Table of Contents
imposition of additional legislative or regulatory requirements related to illicit trade practices; and
▪
potential adverse changes in tobacco leaf price, availability and quality.
In addition to and in connection with the foregoing business and legal challenges, our tobacco subsidiaries are subject to evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences.  Altria Group, Inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries believe that a significant number of adult tobacco consumers switch between tobacco categories or use multiple forms of tobacco products and that approximately 30% of adult smokers are interested in spit-free smokeless tobacco alternatives to cigarettes.  Future success is dependent in part on the ability of Altria Group, Inc. and its tobacco subsidiaries to meet these evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences by developing over time new products and markets within and potentially outside the United States through technological innovation (including, where appropriate, arrangements with third parties) and pursuit of their adjacency growth strategies. See Item 1A for certain risks associated with the foregoing discussion.
We have provided additional detail on the following topics below:
▪
FSPTCA and FDA Regulation;
▪
Excise Taxes;
▪
International Treaty on Tobacco Control;
▪
State Settlement Agreements;
▪
Other Federal, State and Local Regulation and Activity;
▪
Illicit Trade;

Timing of Sales.
FSPTCA and FDA Regulation
▪
The Regulatory Framework:
The FSPTCA expressly establishes certain restrictions and prohibitions on our cigarette and smokeless tobacco businesses and authorizes or requires further FDA action.  Under the FSPTCA, the FDA has broad authority to regulate the design, manufacture, packaging, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of cigarettes, cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products; the authority to require disclosures of related information; and the authority to enforce the FSPTCA and related regulations. The law also grants the FDA authority to extend its application, by regulation, to other tobacco products, including cigars. The FDA has indicated that it intends to regulate cigars and other tobacco products, but it has not indicated a timeline for the issuance of regulations.
Among other measures, the FSPTCA:
▪
imposes restrictions on the advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of tobacco products, including at retail;
▪
prohibits cigarettes with characterizing flavors other than menthol and tobacco;
▪
bans descriptors such as "light," "mild" or "low" or similar descriptors unless expressly authorized by the FDA;
▪
requires extensive ingredient disclosure to the FDA and may require more limited public ingredient disclosure;
▪
prohibits any express or implied claims that a tobacco product is or may be less harmful than other tobacco products without FDA authorization;
▪
imposes reporting obligations relating to contraband activity and grants the FDA authority to impose other recordkeeping and reporting obligations to address counterfeit and contraband products;
▪
changes the language of the cigarette and smokeless tobacco product health warnings, enlarges their size and requires the development by the FDA of graphic warnings for cigarettes, which it published in June 2011, and gives the FDA the authority to require new warnings;
▪
authorizes the FDA to adopt product regulations and related actions, including:
▪
to impose tobacco product standards that are appropriate for the protection of the public health through a regulatory process, including, among other possibilities, restrictions on ingredients, constituents or other properties, performance or design criteria, as well as to impose testing, measurement, reporting and disclosure requirements;
▪
to subject tobacco products that are modified or first introduced into the market after March 22, 2011 to application and premarket review and authorization requirements (the "New Product Application Process") if the FDA does not find them to be "substantially equivalent" to products commercially marketed as of February 15, 2007, and to deny any such new product application thus preventing the distribution and sale of any product affected by such denial;
▪
to determine that certain existing tobacco products modified or introduced into the market for the first time between February 15, 2007 and March 22, 2011 are not "substantially equivalent" to products commercially marketed as of February 15, 2007, in which case the FDA could require the removal of such products or subject them to the New Product Application Process and, if any such applications are denied, prevent the continued distribution and sale of such products (see
FDA Regulatory Actions
below);
▪
to restrict or otherwise regulate menthol cigarettes, as well as other tobacco products with characterizing flavors;
▪
to regulate nicotine yields and to reduce or eliminate harmful constituents or harmful ingredients or other components of tobacco products; and
▪
to impose manufacturing standards for tobacco products; and
22
Table of Contents
▪
equips the FDA with a variety of investigatory and enforcement tools, including the authority to inspect tobacco product manufacturing and other facilities.
▪
Implementation Timing, Rulemaking and Guidance:
The implementation of the FSPTCA began in 2009 and will continue over time. Some provisions took effect immediately, some provisions have taken effect since the enactment of the FSPTCA and other provisions will not take effect for some time. Those provisions that require the FDA to take action through rulemaking generally involve consideration of public comment and, for some issues, scientific review. Altria Group, Inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries are participating actively in processes established by the FDA to develop and implement its regulatory framework, including submission of comments to various FDA proposals and participation in public hearings and engagement sessions.
From time to time, the FDA also issues guidance for public comment, which may be issued in draft or final form.  Such guidance, when finalized, is intended to represent the FDA's current thinking on a particular topic and may be predictive of the FDA's enforcement stance on that topic.  Such guidance, even when finalized, is not intended to bind the FDA or the public or establish legally enforceable responsibilities.  Examples of current draft guidance include:
▪
Draft Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff: Demonstrating the Substantial Equivalence of a New Tobacco Product: Responses to Frequently Asked Questions
▪
Draft Guidance for Industry:  Modified Risk Tobacco Product Applications
▪
Draft Guidance for Industry:  Applications for Premarket Review of New Tobacco Products
A complete set of guidance documents issued by the FDA can be found on the FDA's website at www.fda.gov/TobaccoProductsGuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation.  The information on this website is not, and shall not be deemed to be, part of this report or incorporated into any other filings Altria Group, Inc. makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").
PM USA and USSTC submit comments to the FDA on draft or final guidance when appropriate.  In some cases, PM USA and USSTC may disagree with a particular interpretation by the FDA as expressed in draft or final guidance and may communicate their position in writing to the FDA.  For example, PM USA and USSTC communicated disagreement with FDA interpretations of the statute set forth in the "Draft Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff:  Demonstrating the Substantial Equivalence of a New Tobacco Product: Responses to Frequently Asked Questions" regarding when a manufacturer must submit substantial equivalence reports.  While PM USA and USSTC believe that all of their current products meet the statutory requirements of the FSPTCA, they cannot predict whether, when or how the FDA ultimately will apply its guidance or seek to enforce the law and regulations consistent with its guidance.  As discussed below in
Investigations and Enforcement
, FDA enforcement actions could
have a material adverse effect on the business, financial position, cash flows and results of operations of Altria Group, Inc. and its tobacco subsidiaries.
The implementation of the FSPTCA and related regulations and guidance also may have an impact on enforcement efforts by states, territories and localities of the United States of their laws and regulations as well as of the State Settlement Agreements discussed below (see
State Settlement Agreements
below).  Such enforcement efforts may adversely affect our tobacco subsidiaries' ability to market and sell regulated tobacco products in those states, territories and localities.
▪
Impact on Our Business; Compliance Costs:
Regulations imposed by the FDA under the FSPTCA could have a material adverse impact on the business and sales volume of Altria Group, Inc.'s tobacco businesses in a number of different ways. For example, actions by the FDA could:
▪
impact the consumer acceptability of tobacco products;
▪
delay or prevent the sale or distribution of existing, new or modified tobacco products;
▪
limit adult consumer choices;
▪
restrict communications to adult consumers;
▪
create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain tobacco companies;
▪
impose additional manufacturing, labeling or packaging requirements;
▪
impose restrictions at retail;
▪
result in increased illicit trade activities; or
▪
otherwise significantly increase the cost of doing business.
The failure to comply with FDA regulatory requirements, even inadvertently, and FDA enforcement actions could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial position, cash flows and results of operations of Altria Group, Inc. and its tobacco subsidiaries.
The law imposes fees on tobacco product manufacturers and importers to pay for the cost of regulation and other matters. The cost of the FDA user fee is allocated first among tobacco product categories subject to FDA regulation according to a process set out in the statute, and then among manufacturers and importers within each respective class based on their relative market shares. For a discussion of the impact of the State Settlement Agreements, FETRA and FDA user fee payments on Altria Group, Inc., see
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations-Payments Under State Settlement and Other Tobacco Agreements, and FDA Regulation
below.  In addition, compliance with the law's regulatory requirements has resulted and will continue to result in additional costs for our tobacco businesses. The amount of additional compliance and related costs has not been material in any given quarter to date but could become substantial, either individually or in the aggregate, and will depend on the nature of the requirements imposed by the FDA.
23
Table of Contents
▪
Investigation and Enforcement:
The FDA has a number of investigatory and enforcement tools available to it, including document requests and other required information submissions, facility inspections, examinations and investigations, injunction proceedings, money penalties, product withdrawals and recalls, and product seizures.  The use of any of these investigatory or enforcement tools by the FDA could result in significant costs to the tobacco businesses of Altria Group, Inc. or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the business, financial position, cash flows and results of operations of Altria Group, Inc. and its tobacco subsidiaries.
For example, in June 2010, the FDA issued a document request regarding changes to
Marlboro
Gold Pack cigarette packaging in connection with the FSPTCA's ban of certain descriptors.  PM USA submitted documents in response to the FDA's request.
▪
TPSAC
▪
The
Role of the TPSAC:
As required by the FSPTCA, the FDA has established a tobacco product scientific advisory committee (the "TPSAC"), which consists of both voting and non-voting members, to provide advice, reports, information and recommendations to the FDA on scientific and health issues relating to tobacco products.  For example, the TPSAC advises the FDA about modified risk products (products marketed with reduced risk claims), good manufacturing practices, the effects of the alteration of nicotine yields from tobacco products and nicotine dependence thresholds.  The TPSAC previously made reports and recommendations to the FDA on menthol cigarettes, including the impact of the use of menthol in cigarettes on the public health, and the nature and impact of dissolvable tobacco products on the public health.  The FDA may seek advice from the TPSAC about other safety, dependence or health issues relating to tobacco products, including tobacco product standards and applications to market new tobacco products.
▪
TPSAC Membership:
Beginning in March 2010, PM USA and USSTC raised with the FDA their concerns that four of the voting members of the TPSAC have financial and other conflicts (including services as paid experts for plaintiffs in tobacco litigation) that could hamper the full and fair consideration of issues by the TPSAC and requested that their appointments be withdrawn.  The FDA declined PM USA's and USSTC's requests, stating that the FDA had satisfied itself, after inquiry, that the TPSAC members did not have disqualifying conflicts of interest.  The FDA stated further that it would continue to screen, in accordance with relevant statutory and regulatory provisions and FDA guidance, all TPSAC members for potential conflicts of interest for matters that the TPSAC would be considering.  The FDA also engaged two individuals to serve as consultants to a TPSAC subcommittee who also served as paid experts for plaintiffs in tobacco litigation.  PM USA and USSTC raised similar concerns related to the engagement of these individuals and the FDA similarly declined to terminate
these engagements.  In February 2011, Lorillard Tobacco Company and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the United States Department of Health and Human Services and individual defendants (sued in their official capacities) asserting that the composition of the TPSAC and the composition of the Constituents Subcommittee of the TPSAC violates several federal laws, including the Federal Advisory Committee Act.  In August 2012, the district court denied the government's motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' complaint.

TPSAC Action on Menthol:
As mandated by the FSPTCA, in March 2011, the TPSAC submitted to the FDA a report on the impact of the use of menthol in cigarettes on the public health and related recommendations.  The TPSAC report stated that "[m]enthol cigarettes have an adverse impact on public health in the United States."  The TPSAC report recommended that the "[r]emoval of menthol cigarettes from the marketplace would benefit public health in the United States."  The TPSAC report noted the potential that any ban on menthol cigarettes could lead to an increase in contraband cigarettes and other potential unintended consequences and suggested that the FDA consult with appropriate experts on this matter.  The TPSAC report also recommended that additional research could address gaps in understanding menthol cigarettes.
In March 2011, PM USA submitted a report to the FDA outlining its position that neither science nor other evidence demonstrates that regulatory actions or restrictions related to the use of menthol cigarettes are warranted.  The report noted PM USA's belief that significant restrictions on the use of menthol cigarettes would have unintended consequences detrimental to public health and society.
In July 2011, the TPSAC revised and approved its March 2011 report.  The revisions were editorial in nature and did not change the substantive conclusions and recommendations of the TPSAC.
The FSPTCA does not set a deadline or required timeline for the FDA to act on the TPSAC report.  The FDA has stated that the TPSAC report is only a recommendation and that the FDA's receipt of the TPSAC's report will not have an immediate effect on the availability of menthol cigarettes. In January 2012, the FDA announced that it had evaluated scientific information on menthol and had drafted a report related to the impact of menthol in cigarettes on public health.  The FDA indicated that it had sent its report to external scientists for peer review.  It also indicated that it will make its final draft report and related information available for public comment, although it has not yet done so.  Any future action taken by the FDA to regulate the manufacture, marketing or sale of menthol cigarettes (including a possible ban) will require formal rulemaking that includes public notice and the opportunity for public comment.

Final Tobacco Marketing Rule:
As required by the FSPTCA, the FDA re-promulgated in March 2010 certain advertising and promotion restrictions in substantially the same form as regulations that were previously adopted in 1996 (but never imposed on tobacco manufacturers due to a United States Supreme Court ruling) (the "Final Tobacco Marketing Rule").  The Final Tobacco Marketing Rule:
▪
bans the use of color and graphics in tobacco product labeling and advertising;
▪
prohibits the sale of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to underage persons;
▪
restricts the use of non-tobacco trade and brand names on cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products;
▪
requires the sale of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco in direct, face-to-face transactions;
▪
prohibits sampling of cigarettes and prohibits sampling of smokeless tobacco products except in qualified adult-only facilities;
▪
prohibits gifts or other items in exchange for buying cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products;
▪
prohibits the sale or distribution of items such as hats and tee shirts with tobacco brands or logos; and
▪
prohibits brand name sponsorship of any athletic, musical, artistic, or other social or cultural event, or any entry or team in any event.
Subject to the limitations described below, the Final Tobacco Marketing Rule took effect in June 2010.  At the time of the re-promulgation of the Final Tobacco Marketing Rule, the FDA also issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the so-called "1000 foot rule," which would establish restrictions on the placement of outdoor tobacco advertising in relation to schools and playgrounds.  PM USA and USSTC submitted comments on this advance notice.
Since enactment, several lawsuits have been filed challenging various provisions of the FSPTCA and the Final Tobacco Marketing Rule, including their constitutionality and the scope of the FDA's authority thereunder. Altria Group, Inc. and its tobacco subsidiaries are not parties to any of these lawsuits. In January 2010, in one such challenge (
Commonwealth Brands
), the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky struck down as unconstitutional, and enjoined enforcement of, the portion of the Final Tobacco Marketing Rule that bans the use of color and graphics in labeling and advertising and claims implying that a tobacco product is safer because of FDA regulation. The parties appealed and in March 2012, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part the district court's decision.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed the district court's injunction against enforcement of the portion of the Final Tobacco Marketing Rule that bans the use of color and graphics in labeling and advertising. The Sixth Circuit reversed the injunction against enforcement of the
prohibition on claims implying that a tobacco product is safer because of FDA regulation.  The Sixth Circuit also held that the Final Tobacco Marketing Rule's ban on consumer continuity programs violates the First Amendment and reversed the district court's decision upholding the ban.  The Sixth Circuit upheld the FSPTCA's statutory requirements for enlarged textual and graphic warnings on cigarette packages and advertising, but did not rule upon the constitutionality of the nine graphic warnings actually selected by the FDA in its June 2011 final rule.  In May 2012, the plaintiffs in
Commonwealth Brands
filed a petition for rehearing and rehearing
en banc
, which the Sixth Circuit denied.  In October 2012, the plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of
certiorari
in the United States Supreme Court seeking further review of the Sixth Circuit's decision upholding the FSPTCA's new enlarged and expanded warning requirements that include graphic warnings, the FSPTCA's restrictions on modified risk tobacco product claims and certain other provisions of the Final Tobacco Marketing Rule.  The FDA did not file a petition for writ of
certiorari
with the United States Supreme Court seeking further review of the Sixth Circuit's decision.  For a further discussion of this final rule and the challenge pending in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, see
FDA Regulatory Actions-Graphics Warnings
below.  The FDA has indicated that it does not intend to enforce the ban on the use of color and graphics in labeling and advertising for the duration of the injunction.
In a separate challenge to the Final Tobacco Marketing Rule in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Renegade Tobacco Company, Inc. and others have challenged the constitutionality of an FDA regulation that restricts tobacco manufacturers from using the trade or brand name of a non-tobacco product on cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products.  In May 2010, the Court issued a stay in the Renegade case pending the FDA's consideration of amendments to the trade or brand name rule.  In November 2011, the FDA proposed an amended rule, but continues to exercise its discretion to enforce the original trade or brand name provisions of the Final Tobacco Marketing Rule according to FDA guidance issued in May 2010.  It is not possible to predict the outcome of any such litigation or its effect on the extent of the FDA's authority to regulate tobacco products.
▪
Contraband:
The FSPTCA imposes on manufacturers reporting obligations relating to knowledge of suspected contraband activity involving their brands and also grants the FDA the authority to impose certain other recordkeeping and reporting obligations to address counterfeit and contraband tobacco products. The FSPTCA also empowers the FDA to assess whether additional tools should be employed to track and trace tobacco products through the distribution chain.
▪
FDA Regulatory Actions
▪
Graphic Warnings:
In June 2011, as required by the FSPTCA, the FDA issued its final rule to modify the required warnings that appear on cigarette packages and in cigarette advertisements.  The FSPTCA requires the warnings to
25
Table of Contents
consist of nine new textual warning statements accompanied by color graphics depicting the negative health consequences of smoking.  The graphic health warnings will (i) be located beneath the cellophane, and comprise the top 50 percent of the front and rear panels of cigarette packages, and (ii) occupy 20 percent of a cigarette advertisement and be located at the top of the advertisement.
The rule requires that cigarette packaging manufactured after September 22, 2012 contain the new graphic warnings and all cigarette advertising contain the new warnings by that date.  In August 2011, however, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, Lorillard Tobacco Company and several other plaintiffs filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the FDA challenging its graphic warnings rule. In November 2011, the district court granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, thereby staying enforcement of the graphic warnings rule until 15 months after a final ruling from the district court.  In February 2012, the district court entered final judgment on behalf of the plaintiffs, enjoining enforcement of the graphic warnings rule.  The FDA appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  In August 2012, the Court of Appeals affirmed the ruling of the district court.  The FDA filed a petition for panel rehearing and rehearing
en banc
with the Court of Appeals, which was denied on December 5, 2012.
PM USA is not a party to this lawsuit, but the FDA has confirmed that it will not enforce the graphic warnings rule against PM USA on the same terms and with the same effect as the district court injunction discussed above.
▪
New Product Marketing Authorization Processes:
In January 2011, the FDA issued guidance concerning reports that manufacturers must submit for certain FDA-regulated tobacco products that the manufacturer modified or introduced for the first time into the market after February 15, 2007.  These reports must be reviewed by the agency to determine if such tobacco products are "substantially equivalent" to products commercially available as of February 15, 2007.  In general, in order to continue marketing these products sold before March 22, 2011, manufacturers of FDA-regulated tobacco products were required to send to the FDA a report demonstrating substantial equivalence by March 22, 2011. PM USA and USSTC submitted timely reports.  PM USA and USSTC can continue marketing these products unless the FDA makes a determination that a specific product is not substantially equivalent.  If the FDA ultimately makes such a determination, it could require the removal of such products or subject them to the New Product Application Process and, if any such applications are denied, prevent the continued distribution and sale of such products. PM USA and USSTC believe all of their current products meet the statute's requirements, but cannot predict when or how the FDA will respond to their reports.
Manufacturers intending to introduce new products and certain modified products into the market after March 22, 2011 must submit a report to the FDA and obtain a "substantial equivalence order" from the agency before introducing the products into the market.  If the FDA declines to issue a so-called "substantial equivalence order" for a product or if the manufacturer itself determines that the product does not meet the substantial equivalence requirements, the product would need to undergo the New Product Application Process.  At this time, it is not possible to predict how long agency reviews of either substantial equivalence reports or new product applications will take.
The FDA also published a final regulation in July 2011, establishing a process for requesting an exemption from the substantial equivalence requirements for certain minor modifications to tobacco additives.  The final rule became effective in August 2011.
Excise Taxes
Tobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes in the United States. Significant increases in tobacco-related taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted at the federal, state and local levels within the United States.
Federal, state and local excise taxes have increased substantially over the past decade, far outpacing the rate of inflation. For example, in 2009, the federal excise tax ("FET") on cigarettes increased from 39 cents per pack to approximately $1.01 per pack and on July 1, 2010, the New York state excise tax increased by $1.60 to $4.35 per pack. Between the end of 1998 and February 22, 2013, the weighted-average state and certain local cigarette excise taxes increased from $0.36 to $1.41 per pack.  During 2012, two states (Illinois and Rhode Island) enacted legislation to increase their cigarette excise tax.  As of February 22, 2013, no state has increased its cigarette excise tax in 2013.
Tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of tobacco products by our tobacco subsidiaries, due to lower consumption levels and to a potential shift in adult consumer purchases from the premium to the non-premium or discount segments or to other low-priced or low-taxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products. Such shifts may have an impact on the reported share performance of tobacco products of Altria Group, Inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries.
A majority of states currently tax smokeless tobacco products using an ad valorem method, which is calculated as a percentage of the price of the product, typically the wholesale price. This ad valorem method results in more tax being paid on premium products than is paid on lower-priced products of equal weight. Altria Group, Inc.'s subsidiaries support legislation to convert ad valorem taxes on smokeless tobacco to a weight-based methodology because, unlike the ad valorem tax, a weight-based tax subjects cans of equal weight to the same tax. As of February 22, 2013, 22 states, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Cook County, Illinois have adopted a weight-based tax methodology for smokeless tobacco.

International Treaty on Tobacco Control
The World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control
(the "FCTC") entered into force in February 2005. As of February 22, 2013, 176 countries, as well as the European Community, have become parties to the FCTC. While the United States is a signatory of the FCTC, it is not currently a party to the agreement, as the agreement has not been submitted to, or ratified by, the United States Senate. The FCTC is the first international public health treaty and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation. The treaty recommends (and in certain instances, requires) signatory nations to enact legislation that would, among other things:  establish specific actions to prevent youth tobacco product use; restrict or eliminate all tobacco product advertising, marketing, promotion and sponsorship; initiate public education campaigns to inform the public about the health consequences of tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke and the benefits of quitting; implement regulations imposing product testing, disclosure and performance standards; impose health warning requirements on packaging; and adopt measures intended to combat tobacco product smuggling and counterfeit tobacco products, including tracking and tracing of tobacco products through the distribution chain and restrict smoking in public places.
There are a number of proposals currently under consideration by the governing body of the FCTC, some of which call for substantial restrictions on the manufacture, marketing, distribution and sale of tobacco products.  In addition, the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products (the "Protocol") was approved by the Conference of Parties to the FCTC on November 12, 2012.  It includes provisions related to the tracking and tracing of tobacco products through the distribution chain and numerous other provisions regarding the regulation of the manufacture, distribution, and sale of tobacco products.  The Protocol has not yet entered into force, but in any event will not apply to the United States until the Senate ratifies the FCTC.  It is not possible to predict the outcome of these proposals or the impact of any FCTC actions on legislation or regulation in the United States, either directly as a result of the United States becoming a party to the FCTC, or whether or how these actions might indirectly influence FDA regulation and enforcement.
State Settlement Agreements
As discussed in Note 18, during 1997 and 1998, PM USA and other major domestic tobacco product manufacturers entered into agreements with states and various United States jurisdictions settling asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims (collectively, the "State Settlement Agreements"). These settlements require participating manufacturers to make substantial annual payments, which are adjusted for several factors, including inflation, market share and industry volume. For a discussion of the impact of the State Settlement Agreements, FETRA and FDA user fee payments on Altria
Group, Inc., see
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations - Payments Under State Settlement and Other Tobacco Agreements, and FDA Regulation
below.  The settlements also place numerous requirements and restrictions on participating manufacturers' business operations, including prohibitions and restrictions on the advertising and marketing of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products. Among these are prohibitions of outdoor and transit brand advertising, payments for product placement and free sampling (except in adult-only facilities). Restrictions are also placed on the use of brand name sponsorships and brand name non-tobacco products. The State Settlement Agreements also place prohibitions on targeting youth and the use of cartoon characters. In addition, the State Settlement Agreements require companies to affirm corporate principles directed at reducing underage use of cigarettes; impose requirements regarding lobbying activities; mandate public disclosure of certain industry documents; limit the industry's ability to challenge certain tobacco control and underage use laws; and provide for the dissolution of certain tobacco-related organizations and place restrictions on the establishment of any replacement organizations.
In November 1998, USSTC entered into the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (the "STMSA") with the attorneys general of various states and United States territories to resolve the remaining health care cost reimbursement cases initiated against USSTC. The STMSA required USSTC to adopt various marketing and advertising restrictions. USSTC is the only smokeless tobacco manufacturer to sign the STMSA.
Other Federal, State and Local Regulation and Activity
▪
Federal, State and Local Laws
▪
State and Local Laws Addressing Certain Characterizing Flavors:
In a growing number of states and localities, legislation has been enacted or proposed that prohibits or would prohibit the sale of certain tobacco products with certain characterizing flavors. The legislation varies in terms of the type of tobacco products subject to prohibition, the conditions under which the sale of such products is or would be prohibited, and exceptions to the prohibitions. For example, a number of proposals would prohibit characterizing flavors in smokeless tobacco products, with no exception for mint- or wintergreen-flavored products.
To date, the following states have enacted legislation that prohibits certain tobacco products with certain characterizing flavors:
Maine
enacted legislation that prohibits the sale of certain flavored cigar and cigarette products. As implemented, including the application of certain statutory exemptions, this prohibition did not ban any PM USA, USSTC or Middleton product. In 2010, Maine amended the characterizing flavor prohibition.  The amendment allows the continued sale of cigars that obtained favorable exemption rulings under the previous statute but does not provide for the possibility of further exemptions, such as for future products with characterizing flavors.
27
Table of Contents
New Jersey
enacted legislation banning the sale and marketing of cigarettes with a characterizing flavor other than menthol, mint or clove. This legislation does not ban any PM USA, USSTC or Middleton product.
In addition, such legislation has been enacted or is being considered in a number of localities.  For example:
New York City
adopted an ordinance that prohibits the sale of certain flavored tobacco products other than cigarettes. This legislation affects certain USSTC and Middleton products. The ordinance and related final regulations took effect in August 2010.  Certain subsidiaries of USSTC have filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York challenging the New York City legislation on the grounds that it is preempted by the FSPTCA. In March 2010, the district court denied plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction against enforcement of the ordinance and, in November 2011, the district court denied plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, and granted New York City's cross-motion for summary judgment, on the preemption claim.  Plaintiffs have appealed the denial to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and, in the meantime, are complying with the ordinance pending resolution of the litigation. Argument was heard on November 6, 2012.  On February 26, 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the judgment of the district court upholding the New York City ordinance.
Providence, Rhode Island
adopted two ordinances in January 2012.  One would prohibit the sale in most retail outlets of certain flavored tobacco products other than cigarettes.  This legislation differs in a number of ways from the New York City ordinance, including by attempting to prohibit reference to concepts such as "spicy, arctic, ice, cool, warm, hot, mellow, fresh and breeze."  The second Providence ordinance prohibits licensed retailers in the city from accepting or redeeming coupons for cigarettes and other tobacco products or from selling such products to consumers through multi-pack discounts or other discounts provided in exchange for the purchase of another tobacco product.  In February 2012, Altria Group, Inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries filed a legal challenge to these ordinances in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island challenging the legality of both ordinances on preemption and First Amendment grounds. Plaintiffs filed motions for preliminary injunction and summary judgment in March 2012.  The City of Providence filed a cross-motion for summary judgment in June 2012.  On December 10, 2012, the district court struck the "concepts" language quoted above from the flavor ordinance, but otherwise granted summary judgment for the City of Providence as to both ordinances.  The City of Providence commenced enforcement of the ordinances, as modified by the district court, on January 3, 2013.  On January 8, 2013, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.
Whether other states or localities will enact legislation in this area, and the precise nature of such legislation if enacted, cannot be predicted.  See
FDA Regulation
above for a summary of the FSPTCA's regulation of certain tobacco products with characterizing flavors.
▪
State and Local Laws Imposing Certain Speech  Requirements and Restrictions:
In several jurisdictions, legislation or regulations have been enacted or proposed that would require the disclosure of health information separate from or in addition to federally-mandated health warnings or that would restrict commercial speech in certain respects.  For example, in July 2012, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit determined that an effort by New York City to require retailers selling tobacco products to display a sign, issued by the New York City Board of Health, depicting graphic images of the potential health consequences of smoking and urging smokers to quit was preempted by federal law.  This litigation has concluded.
As another example, the Village Board of Haverstraw, New York enacted a tobacco product display ban in April 2012.  It would have barred tobacco retailers from
displaying
any tobacco product in a manner that a consumer could view the product prior to purchase.  Retailers could maintain a "tobacco menu," listing the types and prices of tobacco products available for sale, but the menu could only be given to a consumer, over the legal age to purchase tobacco products, who requested it.  At all other times, any "tobacco menu" would have been concealed from view.  In June 2012, an association of tobacco retailers, along with several tobacco product manufacturers and distributors (including PM USA, a subsidiary of USSTC and Middleton), filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York challenging the display ban on First Amendment and preemption grounds.  In July 2012, the Village Board voted to approve a settlement of the lawsuit and, in August 2012, voted to repeal the ordinance.  This litigation has concluded.
▪
Federal Tobacco Quota Buy-Out:
In October 2004, FETRA was signed into law. PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to the requirements of FETRA. FETRA eliminated the federal tobacco quota and price support program through an industry-funded buy-out of tobacco growers and quota holders. The cost of the buy-out is approximately $9.5 billion and is being paid over 10 years ending in 2014 by manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product. The cost is being allocated based on the relative market shares of manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product.
In February 2011, PM USA filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia challenging the United States Department of Agriculture's (the "USDA") method for calculating the 2011 and future tobacco product class shares that are used to allocate liability for the industry payments that fund the FETRA buy-out described above and are used by the FDA to calculate the
28
Table of Contents
industry's FDA user fees. PM USA asserted in this litigation that the USDA violated FETRA, and imposed excessive FETRA assessments on PM USA, by failing to apply the most current FET rates enacted by Congress, which became effective in April 2009, in calculating the class share allocations.  The Cigar Association of America has joined the litigation as a defendant intervenor.  In October 2012, the district court denied PM USA's motion for summary judgment, granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment and dismissed the case.  On December 5, 2012, PM USA filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.
For a discussion of the impact of the State Settlement Agreements, FETRA and FDA user fee payments on Altria Group, Inc., see
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations - Payments Under State Settlement and Other Tobacco Agreements, and FDA Regulation
below
.
We do not anticipate that the quota buy-out will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results in 2013 and 2014.
▪
Health Effects of Tobacco Consumption and Exposure to Environmental Tobacco Smoke ("ETS"):
It is the policy of Altria Group, Inc. and its tobacco subsidiaries to defer to the judgment of public health authorities as to the content of warnings in advertisements and on product packaging regarding the health effects of tobacco consumption, addiction and exposure to ETS. Altria Group, Inc. and its tobacco subsidiaries believe that the public should be guided by the messages of the United States Surgeon General and public health authorities worldwide in making decisions concerning the use of tobacco products.
Reports with respect to the health effects of smoking have been publicized for many years, including in a June 2006 United States Surgeon General report on ETS entitled "The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke." Many jurisdictions within the United States have restricted smoking in public places. The pace and scope of public smoking bans have increased significantly. Some public health groups have called for, and various jurisdictions have adopted or proposed, bans on smoking in outdoor places, in private apartments and in cars with minors in them. It is not possible to predict the results of ongoing scientific research or the types of future scientific research into the health risks of tobacco exposure and the impact of such research on regulation.
▪
Other Legislation or Governmental Initiatives:
In addition to the actions discussed above, other regulatory initiatives affecting the tobacco industry have been adopted or are being considered at the federal level and in a number of state and local jurisdictions. For example, in recent years, legislation has been introduced or enacted at the state or local level to subject tobacco products to various reporting requirements and performance standards (such as reduced cigarette ignition propensity standards); establish educational campaigns relating to tobacco consumption or tobacco control programs, or provide
additional funding for governmental tobacco control activities; restrict the sale of tobacco products in certain retail establishments and the sale of tobacco products in certain packing sizes; require tax stamping of moist smokeless tobacco products; require the use of state tax stamps using data encryption technology; and further restrict the sale, marketing and advertising of cigarettes and other tobacco products.  Such legislation may be subject to constitutional or other challenges on various grounds, which may or may not be successful.
It is not possible to predict what, if any, additional legislation, regulation or other governmental action will be enacted or implemented (and, if challenged, upheld) relating to the manufacturing, design, packaging, marketing, advertising, sale or use of tobacco products, or the tobacco industry generally. It is possible, however, that legislation, regulation or other governmental action could be enacted or implemented in the United States that might materially adversely affect the business and volume of our tobacco subsidiaries and our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.
▪
Governmental Investigations:
From time to time, Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters. Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries cannot predict whether new investigations may be commenced.
Illicit Trade
Altria Group, Inc. and its tobacco subsidiaries support appropriate regulations and enforcement measures to prevent illicit trade in tobacco products. For example, Altria Group, Inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries are engaged in a number of initiatives to help prevent trade in contraband tobacco products, including: enforcement of wholesale and retail trade programs and policies on trade in contraband tobacco products; engagement with and support of law enforcement and regulatory agencies; litigation to protect their trademarks; and support for a variety of federal and state legislative initiatives. Legislative initiatives to address trade in contraband tobacco products are designed to protect the legitimate channels of distribution, impose more stringent penalties for the violation of illegal trade laws and provide additional tools for law enforcement. Regulatory measures and related governmental actions to prevent the illicit manufacture and trade of tobacco products continue to evolve as the nature of illicit tobacco products evolves. For example, in March 2010, the President signed into law the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking ("PACT") Act, which addresses illegal Internet sales by, among other things, imposing a series of restrictions and requirements on the delivery-sale of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products and makes such products non-mailable to consumers through the United States Postal Service, subject to limited exceptions.  Certain Internet cigarette sellers filed lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of various aspects of this statute and sought injunctive relief in the United States District Courts for the District of Columbia, the Western District of New York and the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.  In the Western District of New York, the district court enjoined only certain elements of the
29
Table of Contents
PACT Act, including a requirement that delivery-sellers obey the laws of the jurisdiction to which they ship cigarettes. In the District of Columbia, the district court issued a preliminary injunction substantially similar to the injunctive relief issued in the Western District of New York.  The United States Department of Justice is challenging the District of Columbia injunction on appeal and is pursuing a final judgment on the merits in the Western District of New York proceedings.
Tobacco Price, Availability and Quality
Shifts in crops driven by economic conditions and adverse weather patterns, government mandated prices and production control programs may increase or decrease the cost or reduce the quality of tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products. As with other agriculture commodities, the price of tobacco leaf can be influenced by economic conditions and imbalances in supply and demand and crop quality and availability can be influenced by variations in weather patterns, including those caused by climate change. Tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls, including government mandated prices and production control programs. Changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products and the cost of tobacco production could cause tobacco leaf prices to increase and could result in farmers growing less tobacco. Any significant change in tobacco leaf prices, quality or availability could affect our tobacco subsidiaries' profitability and business.
Timing of Sales
In the ordinary course of business, our tobacco subsidiaries are subject to many influences that can impact the timing of sales to customers, including the timing of holidays and other annual or special events, the timing of promotions, customer incentive programs and customer inventory programs, as well as the actual or speculated timing of pricing actions and tax-driven price increases.

Cigarettes retail share results are based on data from SymphonyIRI Group/Capstone, which is a retail tracking service that uses a sample of stores to project market share performance in retail stores selling cigarettes.  The panel was not designed to capture sales through other channels, including the Internet, direct mail and some illicitly tax-advantaged outlets.

Table of Contents
Cigars retail share results are based on data from the SymphonyIRI Group ("SymphonyIRI") InfoScan Cigar Database for Food, Drug, Mass Merchandisers (excluding Walmart) and Convenience trade classes, which is a retail tracking service that measures machine-made large cigars market share performance.  Middleton defines machine-made large cigars as cigars made by machine that weigh greater than three pounds per thousand, except cigars sold at retail in packages of 20 cigars.  This service was developed to provide a representation of retail business performance in key trade channels.  It is SymphonyIRI's standard practice to periodically refresh its InfoScan syndicated services, which could restate retail share results that were previously released.
PM USA and Middleton are transitioning to new retail tracking services to measure cigarette and cigar performance beginning in the first quarter of 2013.

The following discussion compares smokeable products segment results for the year ended
December 31, 2012
with the year ended
December 31, 2011
.
Net revenues, which include excise taxes billed to customers, increased $246 million (1.1%) due primarily to higher net pricing ($404 million), which includes higher promotional investments behind
Marlboro
's new brand architecture, partially offset by  unfavorable mix due to
L&M
's volume growth in Discount and lower shipment volume.
Operating companies income increased $502 million (8.8%), due primarily to higher net pricing ($405 million), which includes higher promotional investments, marketing, administration and research savings reflecting cost reduction initiatives ($162 million), lower asset impairment, exit and implementation costs, net, primarily related to the 2011 Cost Reduction Program ($155 million) and lower charges related to tobacco and health judgments ($94 million), partially offset by unfavorable mix and lower shipment volume ($127 million), higher per unit settlement charges ($123 million) and higher manufacturing costs.
Marketing, administration and research costs for the smokeable products segment include PM USA's cost of administering and litigating product liability claims.  Litigation defense costs are influenced by a number of factors, including the number and types of cases filed, the number of cases tried annually, the results of trials and appeals, the development of the law controlling relevant legal issues, and litigation strategy and tactics.  For further discussion on these matters, see Note 18 and Item 3.  For the years ended
December 31, 2012
,
2011
and
2010
, product liability defense costs for PM USA were $228 million, $272 million and $259 million, respectively.  The factors that have influenced past product liability defense costs are expected to continue to influence future costs.  PM USA does not expect future product liability defense costs to be significantly different from product liability defense costs incurred in 2012.
For 2012, total smokeable products shipment volume decreased 0.2% versus 2011.  PM USA's reported domestic cigarettes shipment volume declined 0.2% for 2012, due primarily to the industry's rate of decline, partially offset by volume growth as a result of retail share gains and one extra shipping day.  After adjusting for an extra shipping day and changes in trade inventories, PM USA's 2012 domestic cigarettes shipment volume was estimated to be essentially unchanged. After adjusting for an extra shipping day and changes in trade inventories, PM USA estimates total cigarette category volume for 2012 to be down approximately 3%.
PM USA's total premium brands (
Marlboro
and Other premium brands) shipment volume decreased 1.2% in 2012.
Marlboro
's shipment volume decreased 0.7% versus 2011.  In the Discount brands, PM USA's shipment volume for 2012 increased 15.3% versus 2011 due to
L&M
's volume growth, partially offset by
Basic
's volume decline.  PM USA's shipments of premium cigarettes accounted for 92.7% of its reported domestic cigarettes shipment volume for 2012, down from 93.7% for 2011.

Middleton's reported cigars shipment volume for 2012 decreased 0.7% due primarily to changes in trade inventories, partially offset by volume growth as a result of retail share gains.
In the cigarette category,
Marlboro
's
2012 retail share performance continued to benefit
from the brand-building initiatives supporting
Marlboro
's new architecture.
Marlboro
's retail share for 2012 increased 0.6 share points versus 2011 to 42.6%.  In January 2013, PM USA expanded distribution of
Marlboro
Southern Cut nationally.

Southern Cut is part of the
Marlboro
Gold family.
PM USA's 2012 retail share increased 0.8 share points versus 2011, reflecting retail share gains by
Marlboro
and by
L&M
in Discount.  These gains were partially offset by share losses on other portfolio brands.
In the machine-made large cigars category,
Black & Mild
's retail share for 2012 increased 0.5 share points.  The brand  benefited from new untipped cigarillo varieties that were introduced in 2011,
Black & Mild
seasonal offerings and the 2012 third-quarter introduction of
Black & Mild
Jazz untipped cigarillos into select geographies.  In December 2012, Middleton announced plans to launch nationally
Black & Mild
Jazz cigars in both plastic tip and wood tip in the first quarter of 2013.
The following discussion compares smokeable products segment results for the year ended December 31, 2011 with the year ended December 31, 2010.
Net revenues, which include excise taxes billed to customers, decreased $221 million (1.0%) due to lower shipment volume ($1,051 million), partially offset by higher net pricing ($830 million), which includes higher promotional investments.
Operating companies income increased $119 million (2.1%), due primarily to higher net pricing ($831 million), which includes higher promotional investments, marketing, administration, and research savings reflecting cost reduction initiatives ($198 million) and 2010 implementation costs related to the closure of the Cabarrus, North Carolina manufacturing facility ($75 million), partially offset by lower volume ($527 million), higher asset impairment and exit costs due primarily to the 2011 Cost Reduction Program ($158 million), higher per unit settlement charges ($120 million), higher charges related to tobacco and health judgments ($87 million) and higher FDA user fees ($73 million).
For 2011, total smokeable products shipment volume decreased 4.0% versus 2010.  PM USA's reported domestic cigarettes shipment volume declined 4.0% versus 2010 due primarily to retail share losses and one less shipping day, partially offset by changes in trade inventories.  After adjusting for changes in trade inventories and one less shipping day, PM USA's 2011 domestic cigarette shipment volume was estimated to be down approximately 4% versus 2010.  PM USA believes that total cigarette category volume for 2011 decreased approximately 3.5% versus 2010, when adjusted primarily for changes in trade inventories and one less shipping day.
PM USA's total premium brands (
Marlboro
and Other Premium brands) shipment volume decreased 4.3%.
Marlboro
's shipment volume decreased 3.8% versus 2010.  In the Discount brands, PM USA's shipment volume decreased 0.9%.  PM USA's shipments of premium cigarettes accounted for 93.7% of its reported domestic cigarettes shipment volume for 2011, down from 93.9% in 2010.
Middleton's 2011 reported cigars shipment volume was unchanged versus 2010.
For 2011, PM USA's retail share of the cigarette category declined 0.8 share points to 49.0% due primarily to retail share losses on

's 2011 retail share decreased 0.6 share points.  In 2010,
Marlboro
delivered record full-year retail share results that were achieved at lower margin levels.

.
For 2011, Middleton's retail share of the cigar category increased 0.3 share points to 29.7% versus 2010.
Black & Mild
's
2011 retail share increased 0.5 share points, as the brand benefited from new product introductions.  During the fourth quarter of 2011, Middleton broadened its untipped cigarillo portfolio with new Aroma Wrap™ foil pouch packaging that accompanied the national introduction of
Black & Mild
Wine.  This new fourth-quarter packaging roll-out also included
Black & Mild
Sweets and Classic varieties.
During the second quarter of 2011, Middleton entered into a contract manufacturing arrangement to source the production of a portion of its cigars overseas.  Middleton entered into this arrangement to access additional production capacity in an uncertain competitive environment and an excise tax environment that potentially benefits imported large cigars over those manufactured domestically.

Wine Segment
Business Environment
Ste. Michelle is a leading producer of Washington state wines, primarily
Chateau Ste. Michelle
and
Columbia Crest
, and owns wineries in or distributes wines from several other wine regions. As discussed in Note 18, Ste. Michelle holds an 85% ownership
interest in Michelle-Antinori, LLC, which owns
Stag's Leap Wine Cellars
in Napa Valley.  Ste. Michelle also owns
Conn Creek
in Napa Valley and
Erath
in Oregon.  In addition, Ste. Michelle distributes
Antinori
and
Villa Maria Estate
wines and
Champagne Nicolas Feuillatte
in the United States.  Key elements of Ste. Michelle's strategy are expanded domestic distribution of its wines, especially in certain account categories such as restaurants, wholesale clubs, supermarkets, wine shops and mass merchandisers, and a focus on improving product mix to higher-priced, premium products.
Ste. Michelle's business is subject to significant competition, including competition from many larger, well-established domestic and international companies, as well as from many smaller wine producers. Wine segment competition is primarily based on quality, price, consumer and trade wine tastings, competitive wine judging, third-party acclaim and advertising.  Substantially all of Ste. Michelle's sales occur through state-licensed distributors.
Federal, state and local governmental agencies regulate the alcohol beverage industry through various means, including licensing requirements, pricing, labeling and advertising restrictions, and distribution and production policies.  Further regulatory restrictions or additional excise or other taxes on the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages may have an adverse effect on Ste. Michelle's wine business.
Operating Results
Ste. Michelle delivered higher financial results in 2012 through higher pricing, improved premium mix and higher shipment volume.

Financial Services Segment
Business Environment
In 2003, PMCC ceased making new investments and began focusing exclusively on managing its existing portfolio of finance assets in order to maximize gains and generate cash flow from asset sales and related activities.  Accordingly, PMCC's operating companies income will fluctuate over time as investments mature or are sold.  During
2012
,
2011
and
2010
, proceeds from asset management activities and recoveries on the sale of bankruptcy claims on, as well as the sale of aircraft under, its leases to American totaled $1,049 million, $490 million and $312 million, respectively.  Gains, net included in operating companies income during
2012
,
2011
and
2010
totaled $131 million, $107 million and $72 million, respectively.
As previously discussed, during the second quarter of
2012
, Altria Group, Inc. entered into the Closing Agreement with the IRS that conclusively resolved the federal income tax treatment for all prior and future tax years of certain leveraged lease transactions entered into by PMCC.  As a result of the Closing Agreement, Altria Group, Inc. recorded a one-time net earnings benefit of $68 million during the second quarter of 2012, which included a pre-tax charge of $7 million that was recorded as a decrease to PMCC's net revenues and operating companies income.  During the second quarter of
2011
, Altria Group, Inc. recorded the 2011 PMCC Leveraged Lease Charge, which included a pre-tax charge of $490 million that was recorded as a decrease to PMCC's net revenues and operating companies income.  For further discussion, see Note 7, Note 14 and Note 18.
PMCC assesses the adequacy of its allowance for losses relative to the credit risk of its leasing portfolio on an ongoing
basis.  During 2012, PMCC determined that its allowance for losses exceeded the amount required based on management's assessment of the credit quality and size of PMCC's leasing portfolio.  As a result, PMCC reduced its allowance for losses by $10 million, which was recorded as income in 2012.
During 2011, PMCC recorded a net increase to its allowance for losses of $25 million which was comprised of (i) an increase of $60 million related to American's bankruptcy filing; and (ii) a $35 million reduction to the allowance for losses recorded during the third quarter of 2011 when PMCC determined that its allowance for losses exceeded the amount required based on management's assessment of the credit quality of the leasing portfolio at that time, including reductions in exposure to below investment grade lessees.
PMCC believes that, as of
December 31, 2012
, the allowance for losses of $99 million is adequate.  PMCC continues to monitor economic and credit conditions, and the individual situations of its lessees and their respective industries, and may have to increase its allowance for losses if such conditions worsen.  All PMCC lessees, including American under its restructured leases, were current on their lease payment obligations as of
December 31, 2012
.  For further discussion of finance assets, see Note 7.

PMCC's net revenues for 2012 increased $463 million (100+%) from 2011, due primarily to lower leveraged lease charges, partially offset by lower lease revenues.  PMCC's operating companies income for 2012 increased $525 million (100+%) from 2011 due primarily to lower leveraged lease charges, the changes to the allowance for losses discussed above and recoveries related to the sale of bankruptcy claims on, as well as the sale of aircraft under, its leases to American, partially offset by lower lease revenues.
PMCC's net revenues for 2011 decreased $474 million (100+%) from 2010, due primarily to the 2011 PMCC Leveraged Lease Charge, partially offset by higher lease revenues, which included gains on asset sales.  PMCC's operating companies income for 2011 decreased $506 million (100+%) from 2010, due primarily to the 2011 PMCC Leveraged Lease Charge and a net increase of $25 million to the allowance for losses, partially offset by higher lease revenues, which included gains on asset sales.

This increase was due primarily to higher earnings in 2012 and higher income tax payments in 2011 associated with PMCC leveraged lease transactions, partially offset by the Closing Agreement with the IRS, which resulted in a payment for federal income tax and estimated interest of $456 million in 2012, and a higher voluntary contribution to Altria Group, Inc.'s pension plans during 2012 ($500 million in 2012 versus $200 million in 2011).
During 2011, net cash provided by operating activities was $3.6 billion compared with $2.8 billion during 2010.  This increase was due primarily to a payment to the IRS of approximately $945 million for taxes and associated interest in July 2010 for certain leveraged lease transactions entered into by PMCC and lower payments in 2011 related to exit and integration costs and State Settlement Agreements, partially offset by a voluntary $200 million contribution made to Altria Group, Inc.'s pension plan during the first quarter of 2011, and higher income tax payments in 2011 related to the decision not to claim tax benefits for certain PMCC leveraged lease transactions beginning in 2010
.
For further discussion of certain PMCC leveraged lease transactions, see Note 7, Note 14 and Note 18.
Altria Group, Inc. had a working capital deficit at
December 31, 2012
and
2011
.  Altria Group, Inc.'s management believes that it has the ability to fund these working capital deficits with cash provided by operating activities and/or short-term borrowings under its commercial paper program as discussed in the
Debt and Liquidity
section below.
Net Cash Provided by Investing Activities
During
2012
, net cash provided by investing activities was
$920 million
compared with
$387 million
during
2011
.  This increase was due primarily to higher proceeds from finance asset sales in 2012.
During 2011, net cash provided by investing activities was $387 million compared with $259 million during 2010.  This increase was due primarily to higher proceeds from finance asset sales in 2011.
Capital expenditures for
2012
increased 18.1% to
$124 million
.  Capital expenditures for 2013 are expected to be in the range of $125 million to $150 million, and are expected to be funded from operating cash flows.
Net Cash Used in Financing Activities
During 2012, net cash used in financing activities was
$5.2 billion
compared with
$3.0 billion
during
2011
.  This increase was due primarily to the following:
▪
debt tender offer completed during 2012, which resulted in the repurchase of $2.0 billion of long-term debt as well as an $864 million payment of tender premiums and fees related to the early extinguishment of debt;
▪
$600 million repayment of UST senior unsecured notes during 2012; and
▪
higher dividends paid during 2012;
partially offset by:
▪
higher debt issuances during 2012; and
▪
lower share repurchases during 2012.
During 2011, net cash used in financing activities was $3.0 billion compared with $2.6 billion during 2010.  This increase was due primarily to Altria Group, Inc.'s repurchases of its common stock during 2011 and a higher dividend rate in 2011, partially offset by higher net issuances of debt during 2011.
Debt and Liquidity
Credit Ratings
- Altria Group, Inc.'s cost and terms of financing and its access to commercial paper markets may be impacted by applicable credit ratings.  Under the terms of certain of Altria Group, Inc.'s existing debt instruments, a change in a credit rating could result in an increase or a decrease of the cost of borrowings.  For instance, as discussed further in Note 9, the interest rate payable on certain of Altria Group, Inc.'s outstanding notes is subject to adjustment from time to time if the rating assigned to the notes of such series by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") or Standard & Poor's Ratings Services ("Standard & Poor's") is downgraded (or subsequently upgraded) as and to the extent set forth in the notes.  The impact of credit ratings on the cost of borrowings under Altria Group, Inc.'s credit agreements is discussed below.

and
Note 18.
At
December 31, 2012
, Altria Group, Inc. had in place a senior unsecured 5-year revolving credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement").  The Credit Agreement provides for borrowings up to an aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion and expires on June 30, 2016.  Pricing for interest and fees under the Credit Agreement may be modified in the event of a change in the rating of Altria Group, Inc.'s long-term senior unsecured debt.  Interest rates on borrowings under the Credit Agreement are expected to be based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus a percentage equal to Altria Group, Inc.'s credit default swap spread subject to certain minimum rates and maximum rates based on the higher of the rating of Altria Group, Inc.'s long-term senior unsecured debt from Standard & Poor's and Moody's.  The applicable minimum and maximum rates based on Altria Group, Inc.'s long-term senior unsecured debt ratings at
December 31, 2012
for borrowings under the Credit Agreement was 0.75% and 1.75%, respectively.  The Credit Agreement does not include any other rating triggers, nor does it contain any provisions that could require the posting of collateral.  At
December 31, 2012
, the credit line available to Altria Group, Inc. was $3.0 billion.
The Credit Agreement is used for general corporate purposes and to support Altria Group, Inc.'s commercial paper issuances.  The Credit Agreement requires that Altria Group, Inc. maintain (i) a ratio of debt to consolidated EBITDA of not more than 3.0 to 1.0 and (ii) a ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense of not less than 4.0 to 1.0, each calculated as of the end of the applicable quarter on a rolling four quarters basis.  At
December 31, 2012
, the ratios of debt to consolidated EBITDA and consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense, calculated in accordance with the Credit Agreement, were 1.8 to 1.0 and 7.0 to 1.0, respectively.  Altria Group, Inc. expects to continue to meet its covenants associated with the Credit Agreement.  The terms "consolidated EBITDA," "debt" and "consolidated interest expense," as defined in the Credit Agreement, include certain adjustments.  Exhibit 99.3 to Altria Group, Inc.'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 sets forth the definitions of these terms as they appear in the Credit Agreement and is incorporated herein by reference.
Any commercial paper issued by Altria Group, Inc. and borrowings under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by PM USA as further discussed in Note 19.
Condensed Consolidating Financial Information
to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 ("Note 19")
.
Financial Market Environment
- Altria Group, Inc. believes it has adequate liquidity and access to financial resources to meet its anticipated obligations and ongoing business needs in the foreseeable future.  Altria Group, Inc. continues to monitor the credit quality of its bank group and is not aware of any potential non-performing credit provider in that group.  Altria Group, Inc. believes the lenders in its bank group will be willing and able to advance funds in accordance with their legal obligations.
Debt
- At
December 31, 2012
and
2011
, Altria Group, Inc.'s total debt, all of which is consumer products debt, was $13.9 billion and $13.7 billion, respectively.
As discussed in Note 9, on August 9, 2012, Altria Group, Inc. issued
$1.9 billion
aggregate principal amount of
2.85%
senior unsecured long-term notes due
2022
and
$0.9 billion
aggregate principal amount of
4.25%
senior unsecured long-term notes due
2042
.  Interest on these notes is payable semi-annually.  The net proceeds from the issuances of these senior unsecured notes were added to Altria Group, Inc.'s general funds and were used to repurchase certain of its senior unsecured notes in connection with the 2012 debt tender offer, and other general corporate purposes.
The obligations of Altria Group, Inc. under the notes are guaranteed by PM USA.  For further discussion, see Note 19.
During the third quarter of 2012, senior unsecured notes issued by UST in the aggregate principal amount of $600 million matured and were repaid in full.
All of Altria Group, Inc.'s debt was fixed-rate debt at
December 31, 2012
and
2011
.  The weighted-average coupon interest rate on total debt was approximately 7.2% and 8.3% at
December 31, 2012
and
2011
, respectively.  For further details on long-term debt, see Note 9.
In October 2011, Altria Group, Inc. filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, under which Altria Group, Inc. may offer debt securities or warrants to purchase debt securities from time to time over a three-year period from the date of filing.

.  From time to time, subsidiaries of Altria Group, Inc. also issue lines of credit to affiliated entities.  In addition, as discussed in Note 19, PM USA has issued guarantees related to Altria Group, Inc.'s indebtedness.  These items have not had, and are not expected to have, a significant impact on Altria Group, Inc.'s liquidity.

Amounts represent the expected cash payments of Altria Group, Inc.'s long-term debt, all of which is consumer products debt.
(2)
Amounts represent the expected cash payments of Altria Group, Inc.'s interest expense on its long-term debt. Interest on Altria Group, Inc.'s debt, which was all fixed-rate debt at
December 31, 2012
, is presented using the stated coupon interest rate.  Amounts exclude the amortization of debt discounts and premiums, the amortization of loan fees and fees for lines of credit that would be included in interest and other debt expense, net on the consolidated statements of earnings.
(3)
Amounts represent the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases.
(4)
Purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and supplies, packaging, storage and distribution) are commitments for projected needs to be utilized in the normal course of business.  Other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services.  Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty, and with short notice (usually 30 days).  Any amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above.
(5)
Other long-term liabilities consist of accrued postretirement health care costs and certain accrued pension costs. The amounts included in the table above for accrued pension costs consist of a voluntary $350 million contribution made on January 2, 2013 as well as the actuarially determined anticipated minimum funding requirements for each year from 2014 through 2017.  Contributions beyond 2017 cannot be reasonably estimated and, therefore, are not included in the table above.  In addition, the following long-term liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the table above: accrued postemployment costs, income taxes and tax contingencies, and other accruals.  Altria Group, Inc. is unable to estimate the timing of payments for these items.
The State Settlement Agreements and related legal fee payments, payments for tobacco growers and FDA user fees, as discussed below and in Note 18 and Item 3, are excluded from the table above, as the payments are subject to adjustment for several factors, including inflation, market share and industry volume.  Litigation escrow deposits, as discussed below and in Note 18, are also excluded from the table above since these deposits will be returned to PM USA should it prevail on appeal.
Payments Under State Settlement and Other Tobacco Agreements, and FDA Regulation
- As discussed previously and in Note 18 and Item 3, PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states and territories of the United States.  PM USA also entered into a trust agreement to provide certain aid to U.S. tobacco growers and quota holders, but PM USA's obligations under this trust expired on December 15, 2010 (these obligations had been offset by the obligations imposed on PM USA by FETRA, which expires in the third quarter of 2014).  USSTC and Middleton are also subject to
obligations imposed by FETRA.  In addition, in June 2009, PM USA and a subsidiary of USSTC became subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA.  The State Settlement Agreements, FETRA and the FDA user fees call for payments that are based on variable factors, such as volume, market share and inflation, depending on the subject payment.  Altria Group, Inc.'s subsidiaries account for the cost of the State Settlement Agreements, FETRA and FDA user fees as a component of cost of sales.  As a result of the State Settlement Agreements, FETRA and FDA user fees, Altria Group, Inc.'s subsidiaries recorded approximately $5.1 billion, $5.0 billion and $5.0 billion of charges to cost of sales for the years ended
December 31, 2012
,
2011
and
2010
, respectively.
Based on current agreements, 2012 market share and historical annual industry volume decline rates, and excluding the potential impact of the NPM adjustment discussed further below and in Note 18, the estimated amounts that Altria Group, Inc.'s subsidiaries may charge to cost of sales for these
38
Table of Contents
payments approximate $5 billion in 2013 and each year thereafter subject to adjustments noted below.
The estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements and FETRA charged to cost of sales in each year would generally be paid in the following year.  The amounts charged to cost of sales for the FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred.  As previously stated, the payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements, FETRA and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, inflation and certain contingent events and, in general, are allocated based on each manufacturer's market share.  Future payment amounts are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results.
Effective December 17, 2012, PM USA and the other tobacco product manufacturers that are original signatories to the MSA (the "Original Participating Manufacturers"), as well as certain other participating manufacturers, entered into a term sheet with 17 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico for settlement of the 2003 - 2012 NPM Adjustments with those states and territories (the "signatory states").  The term sheet provides for a release to the signatory states of their portion of more than $4 billion from the MSA disputed payments account.  The signatory participating manufacturers will receive reductions in future MSA payments.  Based on the current signatory states and an estimate of the 2012 NPM adjustment, PM USA estimates its reductions to be approximately $450 million, all of which PM USA expects, subject to certain conditions, to receive as a credit against its April 2013 MSA payment.  This estimate is subject to change depending on various factors related to the calculation of the credit.
The term sheet is subject to the approval of the arbitration panel in the NPM adjustment arbitration that is currently underway, which approval could come in the form of a stipulated award.  In addition, states that have not joined the term sheet ("non-signatory states") have raised objections concerning the term sheet with the arbitration panel, and a number of non-signatory states have indicated that they may attempt to take action in state court to prevent the settlement from proceeding or to seek other relief with respect to the settlement.  No assurance can be given that the arbitration panel will issue the order necessary for the term sheet to proceed or that the objections or any other such actions by non-signatory states will be resolved in a manner favorable to PM USA.  If the term sheet proceeds, PM USA expects to record a corresponding increase in its reported pre-tax earnings.   The term sheet also provides that the NPM adjustment provision will be revised and streamlined as to the signatory states for years after 2012.  In connection with the settlement, the formula for allocating among the Original Participating Manufacturers the revised NPM adjustments applicable in the future to the signatory states will be modified in a manner favorable to PM USA, although the extent to which it is favorable to PM USA will be dependent upon certain future events, including the
future relative market shares of the Original Participating Manufacturers.  For further discussion see Note 18.
Litigation Escrow Deposits
- With respect to certain adverse verdicts currently on appeal, as of
December 31, 2012
, PM USA has posted various forms of security totaling approximately $36 million, the majority of which have been collateralized with cash deposits, to obtain stays of judgments pending appeals.  These cash deposits are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.
Although litigation is subject to uncertainty and could result in material adverse consequences for the financial position, cash flows or results of operations of PM USA, UST or Altria Group, Inc. in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year as more fully disclosed in Note 18, Item 3 and Item 1A, management expects cash flow from operations, together with Altria Group, Inc.'s access to capital markets, to provide sufficient liquidity to meet ongoing business needs.
Equity and Dividends
As discussed in Note 11.
Stock Plans
to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, during
2012
Altria Group, Inc. granted 1.8 million shares of restricted and deferred stock to eligible employees.
At
December 31, 2012
, the number of shares to be issued upon vesting of deferred stock was not significant.  In addition, there were no stock options outstanding at
December 31, 2012
.
Dividends paid in
2012
and
2011
were approximately
$3.4 billion
and $3.2 billion, respectively, an increase of 5.5%, primarily reflecting a higher dividend rate, partially offset by fewer shares outstanding as a result of shares repurchased by Altria Group, Inc. under its share repurchase programs.
During the third quarter of 2012, Altria Group, Inc.'s Board of Directors approved a
7.3%
increase in the quarterly dividend rate to
$0.44
per common share versus the previous rate of
$0.41
per common share.  Altria Group, Inc. expects to continue to maintain a dividend payout ratio target of approximately 80% of its adjusted diluted EPS.  The current annualized dividend rate is
$1.76
per Altria Group, Inc. common share.  Future dividend payments remain subject to the discretion of Altria Group, Inc.'s Board of Directors.
In January 2011, Altria Group, Inc.'s Board of Directors authorized a
$1.0 billion
one-year share repurchase program (the "January 2011 share repurchase program").  Altria Group, Inc. completed the January 2011 share repurchase program during the third quarter of 2011.  Under the January 2011 share repurchase program, Altria Group, Inc. repurchased a total of
37.6 million
shares of its common stock at an average price of
$26.62
per share.
In October 2011, Altria Group, Inc.'s Board of Directors authorized a new
$1.0 billion
share repurchase program, which was expanded to
$1.5 billion
in October 2012 (the "October 2011 share repurchase program").  During 2011 and 2012, Altria Group, Inc. repurchased
11.7 million
shares (aggregate cost of approximately
$327 million
, and
$27.84
average price per share) and
34.9 million
shares (aggregate cost of approximately
$1.1
39
Table of Contents
billion
, and
$32.00
average price per share), respectively, under the October 2011 share repurchase program.
During 2011, Altria Group, Inc. repurchased a total of
49.3 million
shares (aggregate cost of approximately
$1.3 billion
, and
$26.91
average price per share) under the January 2011 and October 2011 share repurchase programs described above.
As of
December 31, 2012
, Altria Group, Inc. had repurchased a total of
46.6 million
shares of its common stock  under the October 2011 share repurchase program at an aggregate cost of approximately
$1.4 billion
, and an average price of
$30.95
per share.  At
December 31, 2012
, Altria Group, Inc. had approximately
$57 million
remaining in the October 2011 share repurchase program, which Altria Group, Inc. expects to complete by June 30, 2013.  The timing of share repurchases under the October 2011 share repurchase program depends upon marketplace conditions and other factors, and the October 2011 share repurchase program remains subject to the discretion of Altria Group, Inc.'s Board of Directors.
New Accounting Standards
In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued authoritative guidance to improve the transparency of reporting reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income.  The guidance requires an entity to provide additional information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component.  The guidance is effective prospectively for years beginning after December 15, 2012 and for interim periods in those years; however, early adoption is permitted.  Altria Group, Inc. will comply with the authoritative guidance upon adoption in the first quarter of 2013.
See Note 2 for a discussion of new accounting standards issued in 2012.
Contingencies
See Note 18 and Item 3 for a discussion of contingencies.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
.
At
December 31, 2012
and
2011
, the fair value of Altria Group, Inc.'s total debt was
$17.6 billion
and
$17.7 billion
, respectively.  The fair value of Altria Group, Inc.'s debt is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in market interest rates.  A 1% increase in market interest rates at
December 31, 2012
and
2011
would decrease the fair value of Altria Group, Inc.'s total debt by approximately $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively.  A 1% decrease in market interest rates at
December 31, 2012
and
2011
would increase the fair value of Altria Group, Inc.'s total debt by approximately $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively.
Interest rates on borrowings under Altria Group, Inc.'s senior unsecured 5-year revolving credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") are expected to be based on LIBOR plus a percentage equal to Altria Group, Inc.'s credit default swap spread subject to certain minimum rates and maximum rates based on the higher of the rating of Altria Group, Inc.'s long-term senior unsecured debt from Standard & Poor's Rating Services and Moody's Investor Service, Inc.  The applicable minimum and maximum rates based on Altria Group, Inc.'s long-term senior unsecured debt ratings at
December 31, 2012
for borrowings under the Credit Agreement are
0.75%
and
1.75%
, respectively.  At
December 31, 2012
, Altria Group, Inc. had
no
borrowings under the Credit Agreement.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
_________________________
Note 1.      Background and Basis of Presentation
▪
Background:
At
December 31, 2012
, Altria Group, Inc.'s direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries included Philip Morris USA Inc. ("PM USA"), which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and certain smokeless products in the United States; John Middleton Co. ("Middleton"), which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of machine-made large cigars and pipe tobacco, and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PM USA; and UST LLC ("UST"), which through its direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries including U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company LLC ("USSTC") and Ste. Michelle Wine Estates Ltd. ("Ste. Michelle"), is engaged in the manufacture and sale of smokeless products and wine.  Philip Morris Capital Corporation ("PMCC"), another wholly-owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc., maintains a portfolio of leveraged and direct finance leases.  In addition, Altria Group, Inc. held approximately
26.9%
of the economic and voting interest of SABMiller plc ("SABMiller") at
December 31, 2012
, which Altria Group, Inc. accounts for under the equity method of accounting.  Altria Group, Inc.'s access to the operating cash flows of its wholly-owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries.  In addition, Altria Group, Inc. receives cash dividends on its interest in SABMiller if and when SABMiller pays such dividends.  At
December 31, 2012
, Altria Group, Inc.'s principal wholly-owned subsidiaries were not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their common stock.
▪
Dividends and Share Repurchases:
During the third quarter of 2012, Altria Group, Inc.'s Board of Directors approved a
7.3%
increase in the quarterly dividend rate to
$0.44
per common share versus the previous rate of
$0.41
per common share.  The current annualized dividend rate is
$1.76
per Altria Group, Inc. common share.  Future dividend payments remain subject to the discretion of Altria Group, Inc.'s Board of Directors.
In January 2011, Altria Group, Inc.'s Board of Directors authorized a
$1.0 billion
one-year share repurchase program (the "January 2011 share repurchase program").  Altria Group, Inc. completed the January 2011 share repurchase program during the third quarter of 2011.  Under the January 2011 share repurchase program, Altria Group, Inc. repurchased a total of
37.6 million
shares of its common stock at an average price of
$26.62
per share.
In October 2011, Altria Group, Inc.'s Board of Directors authorized a new
$1.0 billion
share repurchase program, which was expanded to
$1.5 billion
in October 2012 (the "October 2011 share repurchase program").  During 2011 and 2012, Altria Group, Inc. repurchased
11.7 million
shares (aggregate cost of approximately
$327 million
, and
$27.84
average price per share) and
34.9 million
shares (aggregate cost of approximately
$1.1 billion
, and
$32.00
average price
per share), respectively, under the October 2011 share repurchase program.
During 2011, Altria Group, Inc. repurchased a total of
49.3 million
shares (aggregate cost of approximately
$1.3 billion
, and
$26.91
average price per share) under the January 2011 and October 2011 share repurchase programs described above.
As of
December 31, 2012
, Altria Group, Inc. had repurchased a total of
46.6 million
shares of its common stock under the October 2011 share repurchase program at an aggregate cost of approximately
$1.4 billion
, and an average price of
$30.95
per share.  At
December 31, 2012
, Altria Group, Inc. had approximately
$57 million
remaining in the October 2011 share repurchase program, which Altria Group, Inc. expects to complete by
June 30, 2013
.  The timing of share repurchases under the October 2011 share repurchase program depends upon marketplace conditions and other factors, and the October 2011 share repurchase program remains subject to the discretion of Altria Group, Inc.'s Board of Directors.
▪
Basis of Presentation:
The consolidated financial statements include Altria Group, Inc., as well as its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries.  Investments in which Altria Group, Inc. exercises significant influence are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  Significant estimates and assumptions include, among other things, pension and benefit plan assumptions, lives and valuation assumptions for goodwill and other intangible assets, marketing programs, income taxes, and the allowance for losses and estimated residual values of finance leases.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Balance sheet accounts are segregated by two broad types of businesses.  Consumer products assets and liabilities are classified as either current or non-current, whereas financial services assets and liabilities are unclassified, in accordance with respective industry practices.
Altria Group, Inc.'s chief operating decision maker has been evaluating the operating results of the former cigarettes and cigars segments as a single smokeable products segment since January 1, 2012.  The combination of these two formerly separate segments is related to the restructuring associated with the cost reduction program announced in October 2011 (the "2011 Cost Reduction Program").  Also, in connection with the 2011 Cost Reduction Program, effective January 1, 2012, Middleton became a wholly-owned subsidiary of PM USA, reflecting management's goal to achieve efficiencies in the management of these businesses.  Effective with the first quarter of 2012 and at December 31, 2012, Altria Group, Inc.'s
48

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
_________________________
reportable segments were smokeable products, smokeless products, wine and financial services.  For further discussion on the 2011 Cost Reduction Program, see Note 4.
Asset Impairment, Exit, Implementation and Integration Costs
.
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year's presentation due primarily to Altria Group, Inc.'s revised reportable segments and Middleton becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of PM USA.
Effective January 1, 2012, Altria Group, Inc. adopted new authoritative guidance that eliminated the option of presenting components of other comprehensive earnings as part of the statement of stockholders' equity.  With the adoption of this guidance, Altria Group, Inc. is reporting other comprehensive earnings in separate statements immediately following the statements of earnings.
Note 2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
▪
Cash and Cash Equivalents:
Cash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.  Cash equivalents are stated at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value.
▪
Depreciation, Amortization, Impairment Testing and Asset Valuation:
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical costs and depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.  Machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods up to
25
years, and buildings and building improvements over periods up to
50
years.  Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives up to
25
years.
Altria Group, Inc. reviews long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable.  Altria Group, Inc. performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists.  For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, Altria Group, Inc. groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable.  If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value.  Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.
Altria Group, Inc. conducts a required annual review of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would require Altria Group, Inc. to perform an interim review.  Goodwill impairment testing requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of each reporting unit.  If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, goodwill is considered impaired.  The amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill, which is determined using discounted cash flows.  Impairment testing for indefinite-lived
intangible assets requires a comparison between the fair value and carrying value of the intangible asset.  If the carrying value exceeds fair value, the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value.  During
2012
,
2011
and
2010
, Altria Group, Inc. completed its annual review of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, and
no
impairment charges resulted from these reviews.
▪
Environmental Costs:
Altria Group, Inc. is subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Altria Group, Inc. provides for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated.  Such accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change.
Compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including the payment of any remediation and compliance costs or damages and the making of related expenditures, has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on Altria Group, Inc.'s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows (see Note 18.
Contingencies
— Environmental Regulation).
▪
Fair Value Measurements:
Altria Group, Inc. measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value.  Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  Altria Group, Inc. uses a fair value hierarchy, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements).  The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are:
Level 1
Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2
Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3
Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
The fair value of substantially all of Altria Group, Inc.'s pension assets is based on observable inputs, including readily available quoted market prices, which meet the definition of a Level 1 or Level 2 input.  For the fair value disclosure of the pension plan assets, see Note 16.
Benefit Plans
.
▪
Finance Leases:
Income attributable to leveraged leases is initially recorded as unearned income and subsequently recognized as revenue over the terms of the respective leases at constant after-tax rates of return on the positive net investment
49
Table of Contents

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
_________________________
balances.  Investments in leveraged leases are stated net of related nonrecourse debt obligations.
Income attributable to direct finance leases is initially recorded as unearned income and subsequently recognized as revenue over the terms of the respective leases at constant pre-tax rates of return on the net investment balances.
Finance leases include unguaranteed residual values that represent PMCC's estimates at lease inception as to the fair values of assets under lease at the end of the non-cancelable lease terms.  The estimated residual values are reviewed annually by PMCC's management.  This review includes analysis of a number of factors, including activity in the relevant industry.  If necessary, revisions are recorded to reduce the residual values.  Such reviews resulted in a decrease of
$8 million
in 2012 and
$11 million
in 2010 to PMCC's net revenues and results of operations.  There were
no
adjustments in 2011.
PMCC considers rents receivable past due when they are beyond the grace period of their contractual due date.  PMCC stops recording income ("non-accrual status") on rents receivable when contractual payments become
90
days past due or earlier if management believes there is significant uncertainty of collectability of rent payments, and resumes recording income when collectability of rent payments is reasonably certain.  Payments received on rents receivable that are on non-accrual status are used to reduce the rents receivable balance.  Write-offs to the allowance for losses are recorded when amounts are deemed to be uncollectible.
▪
Guarantees:
Altria Group, Inc. recognizes a liability for the fair value of the obligation of qualifying guarantee activities.  See Note 18
. Contingencies
for a further discussion of guarantees.
▪
Income Taxes:
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions.
Altria Group, Inc. recognizes a benefit for uncertain tax positions when a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities.  The amount recognized is measured as
the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
Altria Group, Inc. recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes on its consolidated statements of earnings.
▪
Inventories:
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.  The last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method is used to cost substantially all tobacco inventories.  The cost of the remaining inventories is determined using the first-in, first-out and average cost methods.  It is a generally recognized industry practice to classify leaf tobacco and wine inventories as current assets although part of such inventory, because of the duration of the curing and aging process, ordinarily would not be utilized within one year.
▪
Litigation Contingencies and Costs:
Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when it is determined that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  Litigation defense costs are expensed as incurred and included in marketing, administration and research costs on the consolidated statements of earnings.
▪
Marketing Costs:
The consumer products businesses promote their products with consumer engagement programs, consumer incentives and trade promotions.  Such programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives, event marketing and volume-based incentives.  Consumer engagement programs are expensed as incurred.  Consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction of revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period, based principally on historical utilization and redemption rates.  For interim reporting purposes, consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.
▪
Revenue Recognition:
The consumer products businesses recognize revenues, net of sales incentives and sales returns, and including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, upon shipment or delivery of goods when title and risk of loss pass to customers.  Payments received in advance of revenue recognition are deferred and recorded in other accrued liabilities until revenue is recognized.  Altria Group, Inc.'s consumer products businesses also include excise taxes billed to customers in net revenues.  Shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of sales.
▪
Stock-Based Compensation:
Altria Group, Inc. measures compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognizes compensation expense over the service periods for awards expected to vest.  The fair value of restricted stock and deferred stock is determined based on the number of shares granted and the market value at date of grant.
▪
New Accounting Standards:
In July 2012, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued authoritative guidance with an option that simplifies how entities test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.  The guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test.  The new guidance is effective for interim and annual impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012; however, early adoption is permitted.  Altria Group, Inc. performed the quantitative impairment test under existing guidance for its 2012 annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test and will evaluate the impact of performing a qualitative assessment under the new guidance in 2013.

Other charges in the table above primarily include other employee termination benefits, including pension and postretirement, and asset impairments.  Charges, net in the table above include the reversal in 2012 of severance costs (
$8 million
) associated with the 2011 Cost Reduction Program and the reversal in 2011 of lease exit costs (
$4 million
) associated with the UST integration.
The pre-tax asset impairment, exit, implementation and integration costs for 2012 and 2011 shown above are primarily related to the 2011 Cost Reduction Program discussed below.
▪
2011 Cost Reduction Program:
In October 2011, Altria Group, Inc. announced the 2011 Cost Reduction Program for its tobacco and service company subsidiaries, reflecting Altria Group, Inc.'s objective to reduce cigarette-related infrastructure ahead of PM USA’s cigarettes volume declines.  For this program, Altria Group, Inc. incurred total net pre-tax charges of
$271 million
as of
December 31, 2012
.  The net pre-tax charges included employee separation costs of
$209 million
and other net charges of
$62 million
.  These other net charges included lease termination and asset impairments, partially offset by a curtailment gain related to amendments made to an Altria Group, Inc. postretirement benefit plan.  Substantially all of these charges will result in cash expenditures.  Total pre-tax charges, net, incurred related to this program have been substantially completed.
For the year ended
December 31, 2012
, total pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs of
$52 million
were recorded for this program in the smokeable products segment (
$29 million
), smokeless products segment (
$22 million
), and general corporate (
$1 million
).
In addition, pre-tax implementation (gain) costs of
$(5) million
shown in the table above were recorded on Altria Group, Inc.'s consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended
December 31, 2012
, as follows: a net gain of
$14 million
, which included a
$26 million
curtailment gain related to amendments made to an Altria Group, Inc. postretirement benefit plan, was included in marketing, administration and research costs; and other costs of
$9 million
were included in cost of sales.
For the year ended
December 31, 2011
, total pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs of
$223 million
were recorded for this program in the smokeable products segment (
$179 million
), smokeless products segment (
$36 million
), and general corporate (
$8 million
).  In addition, pre-tax implementation costs of
$1 million
, which were recorded in marketing, administration and research costs on Altria Group, Inc.'s consolidated statement of earnings, were recorded in the smokeable products segment.
Cash payments related to this program of
$135 million
and
$9 million
were made during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, for total cash payments of
$144 million
since inception.
In connection with the 2011 Cost Reduction Program, Altria Group, Inc. reorganized two of its tobacco operating companies and revised its reportable segments (see Note 1.
Background and Basis of Presentation
and Note 15.
Segment Reporting
).
▪
Other Programs:
The pre-tax asset impairment, exit, implementation and integration costs incurred during 2010 shown in the table above related primarily to the previously completed manufacturing optimization program associated with PM USA's closure of its Cabarrus, North Carolina manufacturing facility in 2009, and Altria Group, Inc.'s integration and restructuring program in 2008 associated with the integration of UST.
Pre-tax implementation costs of
$75
million were associated with the manufacturing optimization program and were primarily related to accelerated depreciation and were included in cost of sales on the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2010.  Pre-tax integration costs of
$20
million related primarily to the integration and restructuring program  were included in marketing, administration and research costs on the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2010.
Note 5.  Inventories
The cost of approximately
68%
and
70%
of inventories at
December 31, 2012
and
2011
, respectively, was determined using the LIFO method.  The stated LIFO amounts of inventories were approximately
$0.6 billion
lower than the current cost of inventories at
December 31, 2012
and
2011
.

, respectively.
Note 7.  Finance Assets, net
In 2003, PMCC ceased making new investments and began focusing exclusively on managing its existing portfolio of finance assets in order to maximize gains and generate cash flow from asset sales and related activities.  Accordingly, PMCC's operating companies income will fluctuate over time as investments mature or are sold.  During
2012
,
2011
and
2010
, proceeds from asset management activities and recoveries on the sale of bankruptcy claims on, as well as the sale of aircraft under, its leases to American Airlines, Inc. ("American"), which filed for bankruptcy on November 29, 2011, totaled
$1,049 million
,
$490 million
and
$312 million
, respectively.  Gains, net included in operating companies income during
2012
,
2011
and
2010
totaled
$131 million
,
$107 million
and
$72 million
, respectively.
At
December 31, 2012
, finance assets, net, of
$2,581 million
were comprised of investments in finance leases of
$2,680 million
, reduced by the allowance for losses of
$99 million
.  At
December 31, 2011
, finance assets, net, of
$3,559 million
were comprised of investments in finance leases of
$3,786 million
, reduced by the allowance for losses of
$227 million
.
During the second quarter of
2012
, Altria Group, Inc. entered into a closing agreement (the "Closing Agreement") with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") that conclusively resolved the federal income tax treatment for all prior and future tax years of certain leveraged lease transactions entered into by PMCC.  As a result of the Closing Agreement, Altria Group, Inc. recorded a one-time net earnings benefit of
$68 million
during the second quarter of 2012 due primarily to lower than estimated interest on tax underpayments.  During the second quarter of
2011
, Altria Group, Inc. recorded a charge of
$627 million
related to the federal income tax treatment of these transactions (the "2011 PMCC Leveraged Lease Charge").  Approximately
50%
of the charge (
$315 million
) represented a reduction in cumulative lease earnings recorded as of the date of the charge that will be recaptured over the remainder of the terms of the affected leases.  The remaining portion of the charge (
$312 million
) primarily represented a permanent charge for interest on tax underpayments.
For the years ended
December 31, 2012
and
2011
, the benefit/charge associated with PMCC's leveraged lease transactions was recorded in Altria Group, Inc.'s consolidated statements of earnings as follows:

For leveraged leases, rents receivable, net, represent unpaid rents, net of principal and interest payments on third-party nonrecourse debt.  PMCC's rights to rents receivable are subordinate to the third-party nonrecourse debtholders and the leased equipment is pledged as collateral to the debtholders.  The repayment of the nonrecourse debt is collateralized by lease payments receivable and the leased property, and is nonrecourse to the general assets of PMCC.  As required by U.S. GAAP, the third-party nonrecourse debt of
$3.9 billion
and
$6.8 billion
at
December 31, 2012
and
2011
, respectively, has been offset against the related rents receivable.  There were
no
leases with contingent rentals in
2012
and
2011
.
At
December 31, 2012
, PMCC's investments in finance leases were principally comprised of the following investment categories: aircraft (
33%
), rail and surface transport (
24%
), electric power (
24%
), real estate (
13%
) and manufacturing (
6%
).  There were
no
investments located outside the United States at December 31, 2012.  Investments located outside the United States, which were all U.S. dollar-denominated, represented
13%
of PMCC's investments in finance leases at
December 31, 2011
.
Rents receivable in excess of debt service requirements on third-party nonrecourse debt related to leveraged leases and rents receivable from direct finance leases at

direct finance lease revenues of

,
2011
and
2010
, was
$54 million

Income from investment tax credits on leveraged leases, and initial direct and executory costs on direct finance leases, were not significant during
2012
,
2011
and
2010
.
PMCC maintains an allowance for losses, which provides for estimated losses on its investments in finance leases.  PMCC's portfolio consists of leveraged and direct finance leases to a diverse base of lessees participating in a wide variety of industries.  Losses on such leases are recorded when probable and estimable.  PMCC regularly performs a systematic assessment of each individual lease in its portfolio to determine potential credit or collection issues that might indicate impairment.  Impairment takes into consideration both the probability of default and the likelihood of recovery if default were to occur.  PMCC considers both quantitative and qualitative factors of each investment when performing its assessment of the allowance for losses.
Quantitative factors that indicate potential default are tied most directly to public debt ratings.  PMCC monitors all publicly available information on its obligors, including financial statements and credit rating agency reports.  Qualitative factors that indicate the likelihood of recovery if default were to occur include, but are not limited to, underlying collateral value, other forms of credit support, and legal/structural considerations impacting each lease.  Using all available information, PMCC calculates potential losses for each lease in its portfolio based on its default and recovery assumption for each lease.  The aggregate of these potential losses forms a range of potential losses which is used as a guideline to determine the adequacy of PMCC's allowance for losses.
PMCC assesses the adequacy of its allowance for losses relative to the credit risk of its leasing portfolio on an ongoing basis.  PMCC believes that, as of
December 31, 2012
, the allowance for losses of
$99 million
is adequate.  PMCC continues to monitor economic and credit conditions, and the individual situations of its lessees and their respective industries, and may have to increase its allowance for losses if such conditions worsen.

PMCC had
28
aircraft on lease to American on November 29, 2011 when American filed for bankruptcy.  As of the date of the bankruptcy filing, PMCC stopped recording income on its
$140 million
investment in finance leases from American.  After assessing its allowance for losses, including the impact of the American bankruptcy filing, PMCC increased its allowance for losses by
$60 million
during the fourth quarter of 2011.  During
2012
, various developments in the bankruptcy of American, including the rejection and foreclosure of certain leases, the purchase by American of certain aircraft and the restructuring of leases at reduced rent levels, resulted in a
$118 million
aggregate write-off of the related investment in finance lease balance against PMCC's allowance for losses.  In addition, as a result of these developments, deferred taxes of
$22 million
were accelerated and PMCC recorded
$34 million
of pre-tax income primarily related to recoveries from the sale of bankruptcy claims on, as well as the sale of aircraft under, its leases to American.  At
December 31, 2012
, PMCC's remaining investment in finance leases from American was
$6 million
.
During
2012
, PMCC determined that its allowance for losses exceeded the amount required based on management's assessment of the credit quality and size of PMCC's leasing portfolio.  As a result, PMCC reduced its allowance for losses by
$10 million
, which was recorded as income in 2012.
The net increase to PMCC's allowance for losses of
$25 million
in 2011 was comprised of the
$60 million
increase to the allowance for losses related to American, as discussed above, partially offset by a
$35 million
reduction to the allowance for losses recorded during the third quarter of 2011 when PMCC determined that its allowance for losses exceeded the amount required based on management's assessment of the credit quality of the leasing portfolio at that time, including reductions in exposure to below investment grade lessees.
PMCC leased various types of automotive manufacturing equipment to General Motors Corporation ("GM"), which filed for bankruptcy on June 1, 2009.  In
2010
, as part of the GM bankruptcy reorganization, General Motors LLC ("New GM"), which is the successor of GM's North American automobile business, was involved in various actions with PMCC relating to the bankruptcy of GM, including a rebate of a portion of its future rents, which resulted in a
$64 million
write-off of the related investment in finance lease balance against PMCC's allowance for losses, as well as the acceleration of deferred taxes of
$34 million
in 2010.  At
December 31, 2012
and
2011
, PMCC's investment in finance leases from New GM was
$93 million
and
$101 million
, respectively.
All
PMCC lessees, including American under its restructured leases and GM, were current on their lease payment obligations as of
December 31, 2012

Note 8.  Short-Term Borrowings and Borrowing Arrangements
At
December 31, 2012
and
December 31, 2011
, Altria Group, Inc. had
no
short-term borrowings.  The credit line available to Altria Group, Inc. at
December 31, 2012
under the Credit Agreement (as defined below) was
$3.0 billion
.
At
December 31, 2012
, Altria Group, Inc. had in place a senior unsecured
5
-year revolving credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement").  The Credit Agreement provides for borrowings up to an aggregate principal amount of
$3.0 billion
and expires on
June 30, 2016
.  Pricing for interest and fees under the Credit Agreement may be modified in the event of a change in the rating of Altria Group, Inc.'s long-term senior unsecured debt.  Interest rates on borrowings under the Credit Agreement are expected to be based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus a percentage equal to Altria Group, Inc.'s credit default swap spread subject to certain minimum rates and maximum rates based on the higher of the rating of Altria Group, Inc.'s long-term senior unsecured debt from Standard & Poor's and Moody's.  The applicable minimum and maximum rates based on Altria Group, Inc.'s long-term senior unsecured debt ratings at December 31, 2012 for borrowings under the Credit Agreement are
0.75%
and
1.75%
, respectively.  The Credit Agreement does not include any other rating triggers, nor does it contain any provisions that could require the posting of collateral.
The Credit Agreement is used for general corporate purposes and to support Altria Group, Inc.'s commercial paper issuances.  The Credit Agreement requires that Altria Group, Inc. maintain (i) a ratio of debt to consolidated EBITDA of not more than
3.0
to 1.0 and (ii) a ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense of not less than
4.0
to 1.0, each calculated as of the end of the applicable quarter on a rolling four quarters basis.  At
December 31, 2012
, the ratios of debt to consolidated EBITDA and consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense, calculated in accordance with the Credit Agreement, were
1.8
to 1.0 and
7.0
to 1.0, respectively.  Altria Group, Inc. expects to continue to meet its covenants associated with the Credit Agreement.  The terms "consolidated EBITDA," "debt" and "consolidated interest expense," as defined in the Credit Agreement, include certain adjustments.

The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate at
December 31, 2012
was
$242 million
, along with
$20 million
affecting deferred taxes.  However, the impact on net earnings at
December 31, 2012
would be
$136 million
, as a result of receivables from Altria Group, Inc.'s former subsidiaries Kraft Foods Inc. (now known as Mondelēz International, Inc. ("Mondelēz")) and Philip Morris International Inc. ("PMI") of
$9 million
and
$97 million
, respectively, discussed below.  The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate at December 31, 2011 was
$350 million
, along with
$31 million
affecting deferred taxes.  However, the impact on net earnings at December 31, 2011 would be
$160 million
, as a result of
receivables from Mondelēz and PMI of
$112 million
and
$78 million
, respectively, discussed below.
Under tax sharing agreements entered into in connection with the 2007 and 2008 spin-offs of Kraft Foods Inc. (now known as Mondelēz) and PMI, respectively, Mondelēz and PMI are responsible for their respective pre-spin-off tax obligations.  Altria Group, Inc., however, remains severally liable for Mondelēz's and PMI's pre-spin-off federal tax obligations pursuant to regulations governing federal consolidated income tax returns.  As a result, Altria Group, Inc. continues to include the pre-spin-off federal income tax reserves of Mondelēz and PMI of
$9 million
and
$97 million
, respectively, in its liability for uncertain tax positions, and also includes corresponding receivables from Mondelēz and PMI of $9 million and $97 million, respectively, in its assets.
During 2012, Altria Group, Inc. recorded an additional income tax provision of
$52 million
for Mondelēz and PMI tax matters, primarily as a result of the closure in August 2012 of the IRS audit of Altria Group, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries' (including Mondelēz and PMI) 2004-2006 tax years ("IRS 2004-2006 Audit").  In addition, as a result of the Closing Agreement with the IRS that conclusively resolved the federal income tax treatment for all prior and future tax years of certain leveraged lease transactions entered into by PMCC,  Altria Group, Inc. paid, in June 2012,
$456 million
in federal income taxes and related estimated interest on tax underpayments.  In addition, Altria Group, Inc. expects to pay approximately
$50 million
in state taxes and related estimated interest, of which
$28 million
was paid in 2012, with the balance expected to be paid in 2013.  The tax component of these payments represents an acceleration of federal and state income taxes that Altria Group, Inc. would have otherwise paid over the lease terms of these transactions.  See Note 7.
Finance Assets, net
and Note 18.
Contingencies
for further discussion of the Closing Agreement and the PMCC leveraged lease benefit/charge.
During 2011, the IRS, Mondelēz and Altria Group, Inc. executed a closing agreement that resolved certain Mondelēz tax matters arising out of the IRS's examination of Altria Group, Inc.'s consolidated federal income tax returns for the years ended 2004-2006.  As a result of this closing agreement and the resolution of various other Mondelēz tax matters, during 2011, Altria Group, Inc. recorded an additional income tax provision and associated interest of
$14 million
.
Altria Group, Inc. and the IRS executed a closing agreement during the second quarter of 2010 in connection with the IRS’s examination of Altria Group, Inc.'s consolidated federal income tax returns for the years 2000-2003, which resolved various tax matters for Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including its former subsidiaries, Mondelēz and PMI.  As a result of this closing agreement, Altria Group, Inc. paid the IRS approximately
$945 million
of tax and associated interest during the third quarter of 2010 with respect to certain PMCC leveraged lease transactions referred to by the IRS as lease-in/lease-out ("LILO") and sale-in/lease-out ("SILO") transactions, entered into during the 1996-2003 years.  See Note 18.

discussion of IRS challenges to PMCC leases.  In addition, as a result of this closing agreement, in the second quarter of 2010, Altria Group, Inc. recorded (i) a
$47 million
income tax benefit primarily attributable to the reversal of tax reserves and associated interest related to Altria
Group, Inc. and its current subsidiaries; and (ii) an income tax benefit of
$169 million
attributable to the reversal of federal income tax reserves and associated interest related to the resolution of certain Mondelēz and PMI tax matters.
The additional income tax provisions of $52 million and $14 million for the years ended
December 31, 2012
and
2011
, respectively, were offset by increases to the corresponding receivables from Mondelēz and PMI, which were recorded as increases to operating income on Altria Group, Inc.'s consolidated statements of earnings for the years ended
December 31, 2012
and
2011
, respectively.  The income tax benefit of $169 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 was offset by a reduction to the corresponding receivables from Mondelēz and PMI, which was recorded as a reduction to operating income on Altria Group, Inc.'s consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2010.  For the years ended
December 31, 2012
,
2011
and
2010
, there was
no
impact on Altria Group, Inc.'s net earnings associated with the Mondelēz and PMI tax matters discussed above.
Altria Group, Inc. recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the tax provision.  At
December 31, 2012
, Altria Group, Inc. had
$66 million
of accrued interest and penalties, of which approximately
$2 million
and
$18 million
related to Mondelēz and PMI, respectively, for which Mondelēz and PMI are responsible under their respective tax sharing agreements.  At
December 31, 2011
, Altria Group, Inc. had
$618 million
of accrued interest and penalties, of which approximately
$39 million
and
$21 million
related to Mondelēz and PMI, respectively.  The corresponding receivables from Mondelēz and PMI are included in assets on Altria Group, Inc.'s consolidated balance sheets at
December 31, 2012
and
2011
.
For the years ended
December 31, 2012
,
2011
and
2010
, Altria Group, Inc. recognized in its consolidated statements of earnings
$(88) million
,
$496 million
and
$(69) million
, respectively, of gross interest (income) expense associated with uncertain tax positions, which in 2011 primarily relates to the 2011 PMCC Leveraged Lease Charge.
Altria Group, Inc. is subject to income taxation in many jurisdictions.  Uncertain tax positions reflect the difference between tax positions taken or expected to be taken on income tax returns and the amounts recognized in the financial statements.  Resolution of the related tax positions with the relevant tax authorities may take many years to complete, since such timing is not entirely within the control of Altria Group, Inc.  It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months certain examinations will be resolved, which could result in a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits of approximately
$90 million
, the majority of which would relate to the unrecognized tax benefits of Mondelēz and PMI, for which Altria Group, Inc. is indemnified
by Mondelēz and PMI under their respective tax sharing agreements.

The tax provision in 2012 includes a (i)
$73 million
interest benefit resulting primarily from lower than estimated interest on tax underpayments related to the Closing Agreement with the IRS; (ii) the reversal of tax reserves and associated interest of
$53 million
due primarily to the closure of the IRS 2004-2006 Audit; and (iii) an additional tax provision of
$52 million
related to the resolution of various Mondelēz and PMI tax matters.  These amounts are primarily reflected in uncertain tax positions shown in the table above.  The 2012 reductions in SABMiller dividend benefit and domestic manufacturing deduction shown in the table above includes a reduction in consolidated tax benefits resulting from the 2012 debt tender offer.  See Note 9.
Long-Term Debt
for further discussion of the 2012 debt tender offer.  The tax provision in 2011 includes a

charge that primarily represents a permanent charge for interest, net of income tax benefit, on tax underpayments, associated with the 2011 PMCC Leveraged Lease Charge, which was recorded during the second quarter of 2011 and is reflected in uncertain tax positions above.  The tax provision in 2011 also includes tax benefits of
$77 million
primarily attributable to the reversal of tax reserves and associated interest related to the expiration of statutes of limitations, closure of tax audits and the reversal of tax accruals no longer required.  The tax provision in 2010 includes tax benefits of
$216 million
from the reversal of tax reserves and associated interest resulting from the execution of the 2010 closing agreement with the IRS discussed above.  The tax provision in 2010 also includes tax benefits of
$64 million
from the reversal of tax reserves and associated interest following the resolution of several state audits and the expiration of statutes of limitations.

Note 15.  Segment Reporting
The products of Altria Group, Inc.'s consumer products subsidiaries include smokeable products comprised of cigarettes manufactured and sold by PM USA, and machine-made large cigars and pipe tobacco manufactured and sold by Middleton; smokeless products manufactured and sold by or on behalf of USSTC and PM USA; and wine produced and/or distributed by Ste. Michelle.  Another subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc., PMCC, maintains a portfolio of leveraged and direct finance leases.  The products and services of these subsidiaries constitute Altria Group, Inc.'s 2012 reportable segments of smokeable products, smokeless products, wine and financial services.
As discussed in Note 1.
Background and Basis of Presentation
, beginning with the first quarter of 2012, Altria Group, Inc. revised its reportable segments.  Prior-period segment data have been recast to conform with the current-period segment presentation.
Altria Group, Inc.'s chief operating decision maker reviews operating companies income to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to the segments.  Operating companies income for the segments excludes general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles.  Interest and other debt expense, net (consumer products), and provision for income taxes are centrally managed at the corporate level and, accordingly, such items are not presented by segment since they are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by Altria Group, Inc.'s chief operating decision maker.  Information about total assets by segment is not disclosed because such information is not reported to or used by Altria Group, Inc.'s chief operating decision maker.  Segment goodwill and other intangible assets, net, are disclosed in Note 3.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2.

Effective with the first quarter of 2013, Altria Group, Inc.'s reportable segments will be smokeable products, smokeless products and wine.  In connection with this revision, results of the financial services business and the alternative products business will be combined in an All Other category.  Altria Group, Inc. is making these changes due to the continued reduction of the lease portfolio of PMCC and the relative financial contribution of Altria Group, Inc's alternative products business to its consolidated results.  Altria Group, Inc. will begin reporting the All Other category and presenting comparable results for prior periods with its 2013 first-quarter results.
Note 16.  Benefit Plans
Subsidiaries of Altria Group, Inc. sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of all employees of Altria Group, Inc.  However, employees hired on or after a date specific to their employee group are not eligible to participate in these noncontributory defined benefit pension plans but are instead eligible to participate in a defined contribution plan with enhanced benefits.  This transition for new hires occurred from October 1, 2006 to January 1, 2008.  In addition, effective January 1, 2010, certain employees of UST and Middleton who were participants in noncontributory defined benefit pension plans ceased to earn additional benefit service under those plans and became eligible to participate in a defined contribution plan with enhanced benefits.  Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries also provide health care and other benefits to the majority of retired employees.
The plan assets and benefit obligations of Altria Group, Inc.'s pension plans and the benefit obligations of Altria Group, Inc.'s postretirement plans are measured at December 31 of each year.

Plan Assets:
Altria Group, Inc.'s pension plans investment strategy is based on an expectation that equity securities will outperform debt securities over the long term.  Altria Group, Inc. believes that it implements the investment strategy in a prudent and risk-controlled manner, consistent with the fiduciary requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, by investing retirement plan assets in a well-diversified mix of equities, fixed income and other securities that reflects the impact of the demographic mix of plan participants on the benefit obligation using a target asset allocation between equity securities and fixed income investments of
55%
/
45%
.  Accordingly, the composition of Altria Group, Inc.'s plan assets at
December 31, 2012
was broadly characterized as an allocation between equity securities (
54%
), corporate bonds (
23%
), U.S. Treasury and Foreign Government securities (
17%
) and all other types of investments (
6%
).  Virtually all pension assets can be used to make monthly benefit payments.
Altria Group, Inc.'s pension plans investment objective is accomplished by investing in U.S. and international equity index strategies that are intended to mirror indices such as the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, Russell Small Cap Completeness Index, Research Affiliates Fundamental Index ("RAFI") Low Volatility US Index, and Morgan Stanley Capital International ("MSCI") Europe, Australasia, and the Far East ("EAFE") Index.  Altria Group, Inc.'s pension plans also invest in actively managed international equity securities of large, mid and small cap companies located in developed and emerging markets, as well as long duration fixed income securities that primarily include investment grade corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, U.S. Treasuries and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities.  The allocation to below investment grade securities represented
14%
of the fixed income holdings or
6%
of total plan assets at
December 31, 2012
.  The allocation to emerging markets represented
5%
of the equity holdings or
3%
of total plan assets at
December 31, 2012
.  The allocation to real estate and private equity investments was immaterial at December 31, 2012.
Altria Group, Inc.'s pension plans risk management practices include ongoing monitoring of asset allocation, investment performance and investment managers' compliance with their investment guidelines, periodic rebalancing between equity and debt asset classes and annual actuarial re-measurement of plan liabilities.
Altria Group, Inc.'s expected rate of return on pension plan assets is determined by the plan assets' historical long-term investment performance, current asset allocation and estimates of future long-term returns by asset class.  The forward-looking estimates are consistent with the overall long-term averages exhibited by returns on equity and fixed income securities.
The fair values of Altria Group, Inc.'s pension plan assets by asset category were as follows:

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for investments measured at fair value, including the general classification of such investments pursuant to the fair value hierarchy.
▪
Common/Collective Trusts

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ("PPACA"), as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, was signed into law in March 2010.  The PPACA mandates health care reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 to 2018, including the imposition of an excise tax on high cost health care plans effective 2018.  The additional accumulated postretirement liability resulting from the PPACA, which is not material to Altria Group, Inc., has been included in Altria Group, Inc.'s accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at
December 31, 2012
and
2011
.  Given the complexity of the PPACA and the extended time period during which implementation is expected to occur, further adjustments to Altria Group, Inc.'s accumulated postretirement benefit obligation may be necessary in the future.

Note 18.  Contingencies
Legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various United States and foreign jurisdictions against Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including PM USA and UST and its subsidiaries, as well as their respective indemnitees.  Various types of claims may be raised in these proceedings, including product liability, consumer protection, antitrust, tax, contraband shipments, patent infringement, employment matters, claims for contribution and claims of distributors.
Litigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending or future cases. An unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco-related or other litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation.  Damages claimed in some tobacco-related and other litigation are or can be significant and, in certain cases, range in the billions of dollars.  The variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions, together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims, demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome.  In certain cases, plaintiffs claim that defendants' liability is joint and several.  In such cases, Altria Group, Inc. or its subsidiaries may face the risk that one or more co-defendants decline or otherwise fail to participate in the bonding required for an appeal or to pay their proportionate or jury-allocated share of a judgment.  As a result, Altria Group, Inc. or its subsidiaries under certain circumstances may have to pay more than their proportionate share of any bonding- or judgment-related amounts.
Although PM USA has historically been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse verdicts have been appealed, there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases.  This risk has been substantially reduced given that
45
states and Puerto Rico now limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all.  As discussed below, however, tobacco litigation plaintiffs have challenged the constitutionality of Florida's bond cap statute in several cases and plaintiffs may challenge state bond cap statutes in other jurisdictions as well.  Such challenges may include the applicability of state bond caps in federal court.  Although we cannot predict the outcome of such challenges, it is possible that the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria Group, Inc., or one or more of its subsidiaries, could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome of one or more such challenges.
Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when they determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  At the present time, while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, except to the extent discussed elsewhere in this Note 18.

Table of Contents
Altria Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
_________________________
(i) management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobacco-related cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in any of the pending tobacco-related cases; and (iii) accordingly, management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes, if any.  Legal defense costs are expensed as incurred.
Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries have achieved substantial success in managing litigation.  Nevertheless, litigation is subject to uncertainty and significant challenges remain.  It is possible that the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria Group, Inc., or one or more of its subsidiaries, could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation.  Altria Group, Inc. and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe, and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases, that it has valid defenses to the litigation pending against it, as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts.  Each of the companies has defended, and will continue to defend, vigorously against litigation challenges.  However, Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of Altria Group, Inc. to do so.
Overview of Altria Group, Inc. and/or PM USA Tobacco-Related Litigation
▪
Types and Number of Cases:
Claims related to tobacco products generally fall within the following categories: (i) smoking and health cases alleging personal injury brought on behalf of individual plaintiffs; (ii) smoking and health cases primarily alleging personal injury or seeking court-supervised programs for ongoing medical monitoring and purporting to be brought on behalf of a class of individual plaintiffs, including cases in which the aggregated claims of a number of individual plaintiffs are to be tried in a single proceeding; (iii) health care cost recovery cases brought by governmental (both domestic and foreign) plaintiffs seeking reimbursement for health care expenditures allegedly caused by cigarette smoking and/or disgorgement of profits; (iv) class action suits alleging that the uses of the terms "Lights" and "Ultra Lights" constitute deceptive and unfair trade practices, common law or statutory fraud, unjust enrichment, breach of warranty or violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ("RICO"); and (v) other tobacco-related litigation described below.  Plaintiffs' theories of recovery and the defenses raised in pending smoking and health, health care cost recovery and "Lights/Ultra Lights" cases are discussed below.
The table below lists the number of certain tobacco-related cases pending in the United States against PM USA and, in some instances, Altria Group, Inc. as of December 31, 2012, December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010.

cases brought by flight attendants seeking compensatory damages for personal injuries allegedly caused by exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ("ETS").  The flight attendants allege that they are members of an ETS smoking and health class action in Florida, which was settled in 1997 (
Broin
).  The terms of the court-approved settlement in that case allow class members to file individual lawsuits seeking compensatory damages, but prohibit them from seeking punitive damages.  Also, does not include individual smoking and health cases brought by or on behalf of plaintiffs in Florida state and federal courts following the decertification of the
Engle
case (discussed below in
Smoking and Health Litigation - Engle Class Action)
.
(2)
Includes as one case the
600
civil actions (of which
346
are actions against PM USA) that are to be tried in a single proceeding in West Virginia (
In re: Tobacco Litigation
).  The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals has ruled that the United States Constitution does not preclude a trial in two phases in this case.  Under the current trial plan, issues related to defendants' conduct and whether punitive damages are permissible will be tried in the first phase.  The second phase would consist of individual trials to determine liability, if any, as well as compensatory and punitive damages, if any.  Trial in the case began in October 2011, but ended in a mistrial in November 2011.  The court has scheduled trial for April 15, 2013.

Pending and Upcoming Tobacco-Related Trials:
As of December 31, 2012,
40
Engle
progeny cases and
six
individual smoking and health cases against PM USA are set for trial in 2013.  Cases against other companies in the tobacco industry are also scheduled for trial in 2013.  Trial dates are subject to change.
▪
Trial Results:
Since January 1999, excluding the
Engle
progeny cases (separately discussed below), verdicts have been returned in
52
smoking and health, "Lights/Ultra Lights" and health care cost recovery cases in which PM USA was a defendant.  Verdicts in favor of PM USA and other defendants were returned in
35
of the 52 cases.  These 35 cases were tried in Alaska (1), California (5), Florida (9), Louisiana (1), Massachusetts (1), Mississippi (1), Missouri (3), New Hampshire (1), New Jersey (1), New York (5), Ohio (2), Pennsylvania (1), Rhode Island (1), Tennessee (2), and West Virginia (1).  A motion for a new trial was granted in one of the cases in Florida and in the case in Alaska.
Of the
17
non-
Engle
progeny cases in which verdicts were returned in favor of plaintiffs,
15
have reached final resolution.  A verdict against defendants in
one
health care cost recovery case (
Blue Cross/Blue Shield
) was reversed and all claims were dismissed with prejudice.  In addition, a verdict against defendants in a purported "Lights" class action in Illinois (
Price
) was reversed and the case was dismissed with prejudice in December 2006.  The plaintiff in
Price
is seeking to reopen the judgment dismissing this case (see below for a discussion of developments in
Price
).
As of December 31, 2012, 34
Engle
progeny cases involving PM USA have resulted in verdicts since the Florida Supreme Court's

Smoking and Health Litigation
▪
Overview:
Plaintiffs' allegations of liability in smoking and health cases are based on various theories of recovery, including negligence, gross negligence, strict liability, fraud, misrepresentation, design defect, failure to warn, nuisance, breach of express and implied warranties, breach of special duty, conspiracy, concert of action, violations of deceptive trade practice laws and consumer protection statutes, and claims under the federal and state anti-racketeering statutes.  Plaintiffs in the smoking and health actions seek various forms of relief, including compensatory and punitive damages, treble/multiple damages and other statutory damages and penalties, creation of medical monitoring and smoking cessation funds, disgorgement of profits, and injunctive and equitable relief.  Defenses raised in these cases include lack of proximate cause, assumption of the risk, comparative fault and/or contributory negligence, statutes of limitations and preemption by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act.

In May 2006, the Oregon Court of Appeals affirmed the compensatory damages verdict, reversed the award of punitive damages and remanded the case to the trial court for a second trial to determine the amount of punitive damages, if any.  In June 2006, plaintiff petitioned the Oregon Supreme Court to review the portion of the court of appeals' decision reversing and remanding the case for a new trial on punitive damages.  In June 2010, the Oregon Supreme Court affirmed the court of appeals' decision and remanded the case to the trial court for a new trial limited to the question of punitive damages.  In
December 2010
, the Oregon Supreme Court reaffirmed its earlier ruling and awarded PM USA approximately
$500,000
in costs.  In March 2011, PM USA filed a claim against the plaintiff for its costs and disbursements on appeal, plus interest.  Trial on the amount of punitive damages began in January 2012.  In
February 2012

Scott
class action and

United States of America
healthcare cost recovery case.
Engle Class Action
In
July 2000
, in the second phase of the
Engle
smoking and health class action in Florida, a jury returned a verdict assessing punitive damages totaling approximately
$145 billion
against various defendants, including
$74 billion
against PM USA.  Following entry of judgment, PM USA appealed.
In May 2001, the trial court approved a stipulation providing that execution of the punitive damages component of the
Engle
judgment will remain stayed against PM USA and the other participating defendants through the completion of all judicial review.  As a result of the stipulation, PM USA placed
$500 million
into an interest-bearing escrow account
that, regardless of the outcome of the judicial review, was to be paid to the court and the court was to determine how to allocate or distribute it consistent with Florida Rules of Civil Procedure.  In May 2003, the Florida Third District Court of Appeal reversed the judgment entered by the trial court and instructed the trial court to order the decertification of the class.  Plaintiffs petitioned the Florida Supreme Court for further review.
In July 2006, the Florida Supreme Court ordered that the punitive damages award be vacated, that the class approved by the trial court be decertified, and that members of the decertified class could file individual actions against defendants within one year of issuance of the mandate.  The court further declared the following Phase I findings are entitled to
res judicata
effect in such individual actions brought within one year of the issuance of the mandate: (i) that smoking causes various diseases; (ii) that nicotine in cigarettes is addictive; (iii) that defendants' cigarettes were defective and unreasonably dangerous; (iv) that defendants concealed or omitted material information not otherwise known or available knowing that the material was false or misleading or failed to disclose a material fact concerning the health effects or addictive nature of smoking; (v) that defendants agreed to misrepresent information regarding the health effects or addictive nature of cigarettes with the intention of causing the public to rely on this information to their detriment; (vi) that defendants agreed to conceal or omit information regarding the health effects of cigarettes or their addictive nature with the intention that smokers would rely on the information to their detriment; (vii) that all defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that were defective; and (viii) that defendants were negligent.  The court also reinstated compensatory damages awards totaling approximately
$6.9 million
to two individual plaintiffs and found that a third plaintiff's claim was barred by the statute of limitations.  In
February 2008
, PM USA paid approximately
$3 million
, representing its share of compensatory damages and interest, to the two individual plaintiffs identified in the Florida Supreme Court's order.
In August 2006, PM USA sought rehearing from the Florida Supreme Court on parts of its July 2006 opinion, including the ruling (described above) that certain jury findings have
res judicata
effect in subsequent individual trials timely brought by
Engle
class members.  The rehearing motion also asked, among other things, that legal errors that were raised but not expressly ruled upon in the Third District Court of Appeal or in the Florida Supreme Court now be addressed.  Plaintiffs also filed a motion for rehearing in August 2006 seeking clarification of the applicability of the statute of limitations to non-members of the decertified class.
In December 2006, the Florida Supreme Court refused to revise its July 2006 ruling, except that it revised the set of Phase I findings entitled to
res judicata
effect by excluding finding (v) listed above (relating to agreement to misrepresent information), and added the finding that defendants sold or

supplied cigarettes that, at the time of sale or supply, did not conform to the representations of fact made by defendants.  In January 2007, the Florida Supreme Court issued the mandate from its revised opinion.  Defendants then filed a motion with the Florida Third District Court of Appeal requesting that the court address legal errors that were previously raised by defendants but have not yet been addressed either by the Third District Court of Appeal or by the Florida Supreme Court.  In February 2007, the Third District Court of Appeal denied defendants' motion.  In May 2007, defendants' motion for a partial stay of the mandate pending the completion of appellate review was denied by the Third District Court of Appeal.  In May 2007, defendants filed a petition for
writ of certiorari
with the United States Supreme Court.  In October 2007, the United States Supreme Court denied defendants' petition.  In November 2007, the United States Supreme Court denied defendants' petition for rehearing from the denial of their petition for
writ of certiorari
.
In February 2008, the trial court decertified the class except for purposes of the May 2001 bond stipulation, and formally vacated the punitive damages award pursuant to the Florida Supreme Court's mandate.  In April 2008, the trial court ruled that certain defendants, including PM USA, lacked standing with respect to allocation of the funds escrowed under the May 2001 bond stipulation and will receive no credit at this time from the $500 million paid by PM USA against any future punitive damages awards in cases brought by former
Engle
class members.
In May 2008, the trial court, among other things, decertified the limited class maintained for purposes of the May 2001 bond stipulation and, in July 2008, severed the remaining plaintiffs' claims except for those of Howard Engle.  The only remaining plaintiff in the
Engle
case, Howard Engle, voluntarily dismissed his claims with prejudice.
The deadline for filing
Engle
progeny cases, as required by the Florida Supreme Court's decision, expired in January 2008.  As of December 31, 2012, approximately
3,300
state court cases were pending against PM USA or Altria Group, Inc. asserting individual claims by or on behalf of approximately
4,400
state court plaintiffs.  Furthermore, as of December 31, 2012, approximately
2,000
federal court cases were pending against PM USA asserting individual claims by or on behalf of a similar number of federal court plaintiffs.  On January 22, 2013, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida (Jacksonville) dismissed
521
Engle
progeny cases with prejudice bringing the total number of federal court cases to approximately
1,500
.  Because of a number of factors including, but not limited to, docketing delays, duplicated filings, and overlapping dismissal orders, these numbers are estimates.
▪
Federal Engle Progeny Cases:
Three federal district courts (in the
Merlob
,
B. Brown
and
Burr
cases) ruled in 2008 that the findings in the first phase of the
Engle
proceedings cannot be used to satisfy elements of plaintiffs' claims, and
two of those rulings (
B. Brown
and
Burr
) were certified by the trial court for interlocutory review.  The certification in both cases was granted by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit and the appeals were consolidated.  In February 2009, the appeal in
Burr
was dismissed for lack of prosecution and, in September 2012, the district court dismissed the case on statute of limitations grounds.  Plaintiff is appealing the dismissal.  In July 2010, the Eleventh Circuit ruled in
B. Brown
that, as a matter of Florida law, plaintiffs do not have an unlimited right to use the findings from the original
Engle
trial to meet their burden of establishing the elements of their claims at trial.  The Eleventh Circuit did not reach the issue of whether the use of the
Engle
findings violates the defendants' due process rights.  Rather, plaintiffs may only use the findings to establish those specific facts, if any, that they demonstrate with a reasonable degree of certainty were actually decided by the original
Engle
jury.  The Eleventh Circuit remanded the case to the district court to determine what specific factual findings the
Engle
jury actually made.
After the remand of
B. Brown,
the Eleventh Circuit's ruling on Florida state law was superseded by state appellate rulings (discussed below), which include
Martin
, an
Engle
progeny case against R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company ("R.J. Reynolds") in Escambia County, and
J. Brown
,
an
Engle
progeny case against R.J. Reynolds in Broward County.
Martin
and
J. Brown
are discussed in more detail in
Appeals of Engle Progeny Verdicts
below.
Following
Martin
and
J. Brown
, in the
Waggoner
case, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida (Jacksonville) ruled in December 2011 that application of the
Engle
findings to establish the wrongful conduct elements of plaintiffs' claims consistent with
Martin
or
J. Brown
did not violate defendants' due process rights.  The court ruled, however, that plaintiffs must establish legal causation to establish liability.  PM USA and the other defendants sought appellate review of the due process ruling.  In February 2012, the district court denied the motion for interlocutory appeal, but did apply the ruling to all active pending federal
Engle
progeny cases.  As a result, the ruling can be appealed after an adverse verdict or in a cross-appeal.  The ruling has been appealed by R.J. Reynolds in the
Walker
and
Duke
cases pending before the Eleventh Circuit.
Most of the
Engle
progeny cases pending against PM USA in the federal district courts in the Middle District of Florida asserting individual claims by or on behalf of approximately
1,500
plaintiffs remain stayed.  There are currently
41
active cases pending in federal court.  On January 30, 2013, the Federal District Court ordered the parties to engage in global settlement mediation of all pending cases.
▪
Florida Bond Cap Statute:
In June 2009, Florida amended its existing bond cap statute by adding a
$200 million
bond cap that applies to all state
Engle
progeny lawsuits in the aggregate and establishes individual bond caps for individual
Engle
progeny cases in amounts that vary

depending on the number of judgments in effect at a given time.  Plaintiffs in three
Engle
progeny cases against R.J. Reynolds in Alachua County, Florida (
Alexander
,
Townsend
and
Hall
) and one case in Escambia County (
Clay
) challenged the constitutionality of the bond cap statute.  The Florida Attorney General intervened in these cases in defense of the constitutionality of the statute.
Trial court rulings were rendered in
Clay, Alexander
,
Townsend
and
Hall
rejecting the plaintiffs' bond cap statute challenges in those cases.  The plaintiffs unsuccessfully appealed these rulings.  In
Alexander
,
Clay
and
Hall
, the District Court of Appeal for the First District of Florida affirmed the trial court decisions and certified the decision in
Hall
for appeal to the Florida Supreme Court, but declined to certify the question of the constitutionality of the bond cap statute in
Clay
and
Alexander
.  The Florida Supreme Court granted review of the
Hall
decision, but, in September 2012, the court dismissed the appeal as moot.  On October 12, 2012, the Florida Supreme Court denied the plaintiffs' rehearing petition.
No federal court has yet to address the constitutionality of the bond cap statute or the applicability of the bond cap to
Engle
progeny cases tried in federal court.

Defendants are seeking review of the case in the Florida Supreme Court.  In addition, there have been a number of mistrials, only some of which have resulted in new trials as of December 31, 2012.
In
Lukacs
, a case that was tried to verdict before the Florida Supreme Court
Engle
decision, the Florida Third District Court of Appeal in March 2010 affirmed
per curiam
the trial court decision without issuing an opinion.  Under Florida procedure, further review of a
per curiam
affirmance without opinion by the Florida Supreme Court is generally prohibited.  Subsequently in 2010, after defendants' petition for rehearing with the Court of Appeal was denied, defendants paid the judgment.

Reynolds, approximately $13 million in punitive damages against Lorillard and approximately $8 million in punitive damages against Liggett Group.

Engle
jury findings but certified to the Florida Supreme Court the question of whether granting
res judicata
effect to the
Engle
jury findings violates defendants' federal due process rights.  In April 2012, the defendants filed a notice to invoke discretionary jurisdiction with the Florida Supreme Court.  In May 2012, the Florida Supreme Court accepted jurisdiction of the case.  Argument occurred in September 2012.
November 2009
Naugle
A Broward County jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff and against PM USA. The jury awarded approximately $56.6 million in compensatory damages and $244 million in punitive damages.  The jury allocated 90% of the fault to PM USA.
In March 2010, the trial court entered final judgment reflecting a reduced award of approximately $13 million in compensatory damages and $26 million in punitive damages.  In April 2010, PM USA filed its notice of appeal and posted a $5 million appeal bond.  In August 2010, upon the motion of PM USA, the trial court entered an amended final judgment of approximately $12.3 million in compensatory damages and approximately $24.5 million in punitive damages to correct a clerical error.  In June 2012, the Fourth District Court of Appeal affirmed the amended final judgment.  In July 2012, PM USA filed a motion for rehearing.  On December 12, 2012, the Fourth District withdrew its prior decision, reversed the verdict as to compensatory and punitive damages and returned the case to the trial court for a new trial on the question of damages.  On December 26, 2012, the plaintiff filed a motion for rehearing
en banc
or for certification to the Florida Supreme Court, which was denied on January 25, 2013.

F. Campbell
An Escambia County jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff and against R.J. Reynolds, PM USA and Liggett Group.  The jury awarded $7.8 million in compensatory damages.  In September 2009, the trial court entered final judgment and awarded the plaintiff $156,000 in damages against PM USA due to the jury allocating only 2% of the fault to PM USA.
In March 2011, the Florida First District Court of Appeal affirmed
per curiam
the trial court's decision without issuing an opinion.  In May 2012, PM USA paid an amount of approximately $262,000 in satisfaction of the judgment and associated costs and interest.  This litigation has concluded.
August 2009
Barbanell
A Broward County jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, awarding $5.3 million in compensatory damages.  The judge had previously dismissed the punitive damages claim.  In September 2009, the trial court entered final judgment and awarded the plaintiff $1.95 million in actual damages.  The judgment reduced the jury's $5.3 million award of compensatory damages due to the jury allocating 36.5% of the fault to PM USA.
A notice of appeal was filed by PM USA in September 2009, and PM USA posted a $1.95 million appeal bond.  In February 2012, the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal reversed the judgment, holding that the statute of limitations barred the plaintiff's claims.  On October 17, 2012, on motion for rehearing, the Fourth District withdrew its prior decision and affirmed the trial court's judgment.  On November 16, 2012, PM USA filed a notice to invoke the jurisdiction of the Florida Supreme Court.  On December 5, 2012, the Florida Supreme Court granted a partial stay pending its disposition of the
J. Brown
case against R.J. Reynolds.
February 2009
Hess
A Broward County jury found in favor of plaintiffs and against PM USA.  The jury awarded $3 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages.  In June 2009, the trial court entered final judgment and awarded plaintiffs $1.26 million in actual damages and $5 million in punitive damages.  The judgment reduced the jury's $3 million award of compensatory damages due to the jury allocating 42% of the fault to PM USA.
PM USA noticed an appeal to the Fourth District Court of Appeal in July 2009.  In May 2012, the Fourth District reversed and vacated the punitive damages award and affirmed the judgment in all other respects, upholding the compensatory damages award of $1.26 million.  In June 2012, both parties filed rehearing motions with the Fourth District, which were denied in September 2012.  On October 15, 2012, PM USA and plaintiffs filed notices to invoke the Florida Supreme Court's discretionary jurisdiction.

Appeals of Engle Progeny Verdicts:
Plaintiffs in various
Engle
progeny cases have appealed adverse rulings or verdicts, and in some cases, PM USA has cross-appealed.  PM USA's appeals of adverse verdicts are discussed in the chart above.
Since the remand of
B. Brown
(discussed above under the heading
Federal Engle Progeny Cases
), several state appellate rulings have superseded the Eleventh Circuit's ruling on Florida state law.  These include
Martin
, an
Engle
progeny case against R.J. Reynolds in Escambia County,
J. Brown
, an
Engle
progeny case against R.J. Reynolds in Broward County,
Douglas
, an
Engle
progeny case against PM USA, R.J. Reynolds and Liggett Group in Hillsborough County, and
Koballa
, an
Engle
progeny case against R.J. Reynolds in Volusia County.  In
Martin
, the Florida First District Court of Appeal rejected the
B. Brown
ruling as a matter of state law and upheld the use of the
Engle
findings to relax plaintiffs' burden of proof.  R.J. Reynolds had sought Florida Supreme Court review in that case but, in July 2011, the Florida Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal.  In December 2011, petitions for
certiorari
were filed with the United States Supreme Court by R.J. Reynolds in
Campbell,
Martin
,
Gray
and
Hall
and by PM USA and Liggett Group in
Campbell
.  The Supreme Court denied the defendants'
certiorari
petitions in March 2012.
In
J. Brown
, the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal also rejected the
B. Brown
ruling as a matter of state law and upheld the use of the
Engle
findings to relax plaintiffs' burden of proof.  However, the Fourth District expressly disagreed with the First District's
Martin
decision by ruling that
Engle
progeny plaintiffs must prove legal causation on their claims.  In addition, the
J. Brown
court expressed concerns that using the
Engle
findings to reduce plaintiffs' burden may violate defendants' due process rights.  In October 2011, the Fourth District denied R.J. Reynolds' motion to certify
J. Brown
to the Florida Supreme Court for review.  R.J. Reynolds is seeking review of the case by the Florida Supreme Court.
In
Douglas
, in March 2012, the Florida Second District Court of Appeal issued a decision affirming the judgment of the trial court in favor of the plaintiff and upholding the use of the
Engle
jury findings with respect to strict liability claims but certified to the Florida Supreme Court the question of whether granting
res judicata
effect to the
Engle
jury findings violates defendants' federal due process rights.  In April 2012,

the defendants in
Douglas
filed a notice to invoke discretionary jurisdiction with the Florida Supreme Court.  In May 2012, the Florida Supreme Court accepted jurisdiction of the case.  Argument occurred in September 2012.
In
Koballa
, in October 2012, the Florida Fifth District Court of Appeal issued a decision affirming the judgment of the trial court in favor of the plaintiff and upholding the use of the
Engle
jury findings with respect to negligence, concealment and conspiracy claims but, like
Douglas
, certified to the Florida Supreme Court the question of whether granting
res judicata
effect to the
Engle
jury findings violates defendants' federal due process rights.  On November 5, 2012, R.J. Reynolds filed an appeal to the Florida Supreme Court and the court entered a stay in the case pending resolution of the
Douglas
case.
As noted above in
Federal Engle Progeny Cases
, there has been no federal appellate review of the federal due process issues raised by the use of findings from the original
Engle
trial in
Engle
progeny cases, although several appeals brought by R.J. Reynolds are pending.
Because of the substantial period of time required for the federal and state appellate processes, it is possible that PM USA may have to pay additional outstanding judgments in the
Engle
progeny cases before the final adjudication of these issues by the Florida Supreme Court or the United States Supreme Court.
Other Smoking and Health Class Actions
Since the dismissal in May 1996 of a purported nationwide class action brought on behalf of allegedly addicted smokers, plaintiffs have filed numerous putative smoking and health class action suits in various state and federal courts.  In general, these cases purport to be brought on behalf of residents of a particular state or states (although a few cases purport to be nationwide in scope) and raise addiction claims and, in many cases, claims of physical injury as well.
Class certification has been denied or reversed by courts in
59
smoking and health class actions involving PM USA in Arkansas (1), California (1), the District of Columbia (2), Florida (2), Illinois (3), Iowa (1), Kansas (1), Louisiana (1), Maryland (1), Michigan (1), Minnesota (1), Nevada (29), New Jersey (6), New York (2), Ohio (1), Oklahoma (1), Pennsylvania (1), Puerto Rico (1), South Carolina (1), Texas (1) and Wisconsin (1).
As of December 31, 2012, PM USA and Altria Group, Inc. are named as defendants, along with other cigarette manufacturers, in seven class actions filed in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, British Columbia and Ontario.  In Saskatchewan, British Columbia (two separate cases) and Ontario, plaintiffs seek class certification on behalf of individuals who suffer or have suffered from various diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, heart disease or cancer, after smoking defendants' cigarettes.  In the actions filed in Alberta, Manitoba and Nova Scotia, plaintiffs seek
certification of classes of all individuals who smoked defendants' cigarettes.  See
Guarantees and Other Similar Matters
below for a discussion of the Distribution Agreement between Altria Group, Inc. and PMI that provides for indemnities for certain liabilities concerning tobacco products.
Scott Class Action
Following a 2004 verdict that awarded plaintiffs approximately
$590 million
to fund a 10-year smoking cessation program and a series of appeals and other post-trial motions, PM USA recorded in the second quarter of 2011 a provision on its condensed consolidated balance sheet of approximately
$36 million
related to the judgment and approximately
$5 million
related to interest, which was in addition to a previously recorded provision of approximately
$30 million
.  In August 2011, PM USA paid its share of the judgment and interest in an amount of approximately
$70 million
.
In October 2011, plaintiffs' counsel filed a motion for an award of attorneys' fees and costs.  Plaintiffs' counsel sought additional fees from defendants of up to
$673 million
.  Additionally, plaintiffs' counsel requested an award of approximately
$13 million
in costs.
In May 2012, after defendants challenged plaintiffs' counsel's request that defendants pay their attorneys' fees directly, as opposed to out of the court-supervised fund, the parties reached a settlement on the amount of fees and costs to be awarded to plaintiffs' counsel.  Plaintiffs agreed that any recovery of fees and costs would come from the court-supervised fund, not the defendants, and indicated they would seek approximately
$114 million
from the fund.  In exchange, defendants agreed to waive
50%
of their right to a refund of any unspent money in the fund after the 10-year program is completed.  The agreement is not contingent on the trial court's granting plaintiffs' request for additional costs and fees.  The trustee of the fund intervened to challenge whether the plaintiffs' lawyers should get any money from the fund or, alternatively, the amount they would recover from the fund.  On December 20, 2012, the trial court awarded the plaintiffs' counsel attorneys' fees in an amount of approximately
$103 million
, all of which have now been paid from the fund.
Other Medical Monitoring Class Actions
In addition to the
Scott
class action discussed above,
two
purported medical monitoring class actions are pending against PM USA.  These two cases were brought in New York (
Caronia
, filed in January 2006 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York) and Massachusetts (
Donovan
, filed in December 2006 in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts) on behalf of each state's respective residents who: are age 50 or older; have smoked the
Marlboro
brand for 20 pack-years or more; and have neither been diagnosed with lung cancer nor are under investigation by a physician for suspected lung cancer.  Plaintiffs in these cases seek to impose liability under

various product-based causes of action and the creation of a court-supervised program providing members of the purported class Low Dose CT Scanning in order to identify and diagnose lung cancer.  Plaintiffs in these cases do not seek punitive damages.  A case brought in California (
Xavier
) was dismissed in July 2011, and a case brought in Florida (
Gargano
) was voluntarily dismissed with prejudice in August 2011.
In
Caronia
, in February 2010, the district court granted in part PM USA's summary judgment motion, dismissing plaintiffs' strict liability and negligence claims and certain other claims, granted plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint to allege a medical monitoring cause of action and requested further briefing on PM USA's summary judgment motion as to plaintiffs' implied warranty claim and, if plaintiffs amend their complaint, their medical monitoring claim.  In March 2010, plaintiffs filed their amended complaint and PM USA moved to dismiss the implied warranty and medical monitoring claims.  In January 2011, the district court granted PM USA's motion, dismissed plaintiffs' claims and declared plaintiffs' motion for class certification moot in light of the dismissal of the case.  The plaintiffs have appealed that decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  Argument before the Second Circuit was heard in March 2012.
In
Donovan
, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, in answering questions certified to it by the district court, held in October 2009 that under certain circumstances state law recognizes a claim by individual smokers for medical monitoring despite the absence of an actual injury.  The court also ruled that whether or not the case is barred by the applicable statute of limitations is a factual issue to be determined by the trial court.  The case was remanded to federal court for further proceedings.  In June 2010, the district court granted in part the plaintiffs' motion for class certification, certifying the class as to plaintiffs' claims for breach of implied warranty and violation of the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act, but denying certification as to plaintiffs' negligence claim.  In July 2010, PM USA petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit for appellate review of the class certification decision.  The petition was denied in September 2010.  As a remedy, plaintiffs have proposed a 28-year medical monitoring program with an approximate cost of
$190 million
.  In April 2011, plaintiffs moved to amend their class certification to extend the cut-off date for individuals to satisfy the class membership criteria from December 14, 2006 to August 1, 2011.  The district court granted this motion in May 2011.  In June 2011, plaintiffs filed various motions for summary judgment and to strike affirmative defenses, which the district court denied in March 2012 without prejudice.  In October 2011, PM USA filed a motion for class decertification, which motion was denied in March 2012.  A trial date has not been set.
Evolving medical standards and practices could have an impact on the defense of medical monitoring claims.  For example, the first publication of the findings of the National Cancer Institute's National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) in June 2011 reported a 20% reduction in lung cancer deaths among certain long-term smokers receiving Low Dose CT Scanning for lung cancer.  Since then, various public health organizations have begun to develop new lung cancer screening guidelines.  Also, a number of hospitals have advertised the availability of screening programs.  Other studies in this area are ongoing.
Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation
▪
Overview:
In the health care cost recovery litigation, governmental entities seek reimbursement of health care cost expenditures allegedly caused by tobacco products and, in some cases, of future expenditures and damages as well.  Relief sought by some but not all plaintiffs includes punitive damages, multiple damages and other statutory damages and penalties, injunctions prohibiting alleged marketing and sales to minors, disclosure of research, disgorgement of profits, funding of anti-smoking programs, additional disclosure of nicotine yields, and payment of attorney and expert witness fees.
The claims asserted include the claim that cigarette manufacturers were "unjustly enriched" by plaintiffs' payment of health care costs allegedly attributable to smoking, as well as claims of indemnity, negligence, strict liability, breach of express and implied warranty, violation of a voluntary undertaking or special duty, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, conspiracy, public nuisance, claims under federal and state statutes governing consumer fraud, antitrust, deceptive trade practices and false advertising, and claims under federal and state anti-racketeering statutes.
Defenses raised include lack of proximate cause, remoteness of injury, failure to state a valid claim, lack of benefit, adequate remedy at law, "unclean hands" (namely, that plaintiffs cannot obtain equitable relief because they participated in, and benefited from, the sale of cigarettes), lack of antitrust standing and injury, federal preemption, lack of statutory authority to bring suit, and statutes of limitations. In addition, defendants argue that they should be entitled to "set off" any alleged damages to the extent the plaintiffs benefit economically from the sale of cigarettes through the receipt of excise taxes or otherwise.  Defendants also argue that these cases are improper because plaintiffs must proceed under principles of subrogation and assignment.  Under traditional theories of recovery, a payor of medical costs (such as an insurer) can seek recovery of health care costs from a third party solely by "standing in the shoes" of the injured party.  Defendants argue that plaintiffs should be required to bring any actions as subrogees of individual health care recipients and should be subject to all defenses available against the injured party.

_________________________
Although there have been some decisions to the contrary, most judicial decisions in the United States have dismissed all or most health care cost recovery claims against cigarette manufacturers.  Nine federal circuit courts of appeals and eight state appellate courts, relying primarily on grounds that plaintiffs' claims were too remote, have ordered or affirmed dismissals of health care cost recovery actions.  The United States Supreme Court has refused to consider plaintiffs' appeals from the cases decided by five circuit courts of appeals.  In 2011, in the health care cost recovery case brought against PM USA and other defendants by the City of St. Louis, Missouri and approximately 40 Missouri hospitals, a verdict was returned in favor of the defendants.
Individuals and associations have also sued in purported class actions or as private attorneys general under the Medicare as Secondary Payer ("MSP") provisions of the Social Security Act to recover from defendants Medicare expenditures allegedly incurred for the treatment of smoking-related diseases.  Cases were brought in New York (2), Florida (2) and Massachusetts (1).  All were dismissed by federal courts.
In addition to the cases brought in the United States, health care cost recovery actions have also been brought against tobacco industry participants, including PM USA and Altria Group, Inc., in Israel (dismissed), the Marshall Islands (dismissed), and Canada (9) and other entities have stated that they are considering filing such actions.
In September 2005, in the first of several health care cost recovery cases filed in Canada, the Canadian Supreme Court ruled that legislation passed in British Columbia permitting the lawsuit is constitutional, and, as a result, the case, which had previously been dismissed by the trial court, was permitted to proceed.  PM USA's and other defendants' challenge to the British Columbia court's exercise of jurisdiction was rejected by the Court of Appeals of British Columbia and, in April 2007, the Supreme Court of Canada denied review of that decision.  In December 2009, the Court of Appeals of British Columbia ruled that certain defendants can proceed against the Federal Government of Canada as third parties on the theory that the Federal Government of Canada negligently misrepresented to defendants the efficacy of a low tar tobacco variety that the Federal Government of Canada developed and licensed to defendants.  In May 2010, the Supreme Court of Canada granted leave to the Federal Government of Canada to appeal this decision and leave to defendants to cross-appeal the Court of Appeals' decision to dismiss claims against the Federal Government of Canada based on other theories of liability.  In July 2011, the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed the third-party claims against the Federal Government of Canada.
Since the beginning of 2008, the Canadian Provinces of New Brunswick, Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador, Quebec, Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Prince Edward Island have brought health care reimbursement claims against cigarette manufacturers.  PM USA is named as a defendant in
the British Columbia and Quebec cases, while both Altria Group, Inc. and PM USA are named as defendants in the New Brunswick, Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador, Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Prince Edward Island cases.  The province of Nova Scotia and the territory of Nunavut have enacted similar legislation or are in the process of enacting similar legislation.  See
Guarantees and Other Similar Matters
below for a discussion of the Distribution Agreement between Altria Group, Inc. and PMI that provides for indemnities for certain liabilities concerning tobacco products.
▪
Settlements of Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation:
In
November 1998
, PM USA and certain other United States tobacco product manufacturers entered into the Master Settlement Agreement (the "MSA") with 46 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the United States Virgin Islands, American Samoa and the Northern Marianas to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims.  PM USA and certain other United States tobacco product manufacturers had previously settled similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota (together with the MSA, the "State Settlement Agreements").  The State Settlement Agreements require that the original participating manufacturers make annual payments of approximately
$9.4 billion
, subject to adjustments for several factors, including inflation, market share and industry volume.  In addition, the original participating manufacturers are required to pay settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees, subject to an annual cap of
$500 million
.  For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the aggregate amount recorded in cost of sales with respect to the State Settlement Agreements and the Fair and Equitable Tobacco Reform Act of 2004 ("FETRA") was approximately
$4.9 billion
,
$4.8 billion
and
$4.8 billion
, respectively.
The State Settlement Agreements also include provisions relating to advertising and marketing restrictions, public disclosure of certain industry documents, limitations on challenges to certain tobacco control and underage use laws, restrictions on lobbying activities and other provisions.
Possible Adjustments in MSA Payments for 2003 - 2011
Pursuant to the provisions of the MSA, domestic tobacco product manufacturers, including PM USA, who are original signatories to the MSA (the "Original Participating Manufacturers" or "OPMs") are participating in proceedings that may result in downward adjustments to the amounts paid by the OPMs and the other MSA-participating manufacturers to the states and territories that are parties to the MSA for each of the years 2003 - 2011.  The proceedings relate to an MSA payment adjustment (the "NPM Adjustment") based on the collective loss of market share for the relevant year by all participating manufacturers who are subject to the payment obligations and marketing restrictions of the MSA to non-participating manufacturers ("NPMs") who are not subject to such obligations and restrictions.

As part of these proceedings, an independent economic consulting firm jointly selected by the MSA parties or otherwise selected pursuant to the MSA's provisions is required to determine whether the disadvantages of the MSA were a "significant factor" contributing to the participating manufacturers' collective loss of market share for the year in question.  If the firm determines that the disadvantages of the MSA were such a "significant factor," each state may avoid a downward adjustment to its share of the participating manufacturers' annual payments for that year by establishing that it diligently enforced a qualifying escrow statute during the entirety of that year.  Any potential downward adjustment would then be reallocated to any states that do not establish such diligent enforcement.  PM USA believes that the MSA's arbitration clause requires a state to submit its claim to have diligently enforced a qualifying escrow statute to binding arbitration before a panel of three former federal judges in the manner provided for in the MSA.  A number of states have taken the position that this claim should be decided in state court on a state-by-state basis.
An independent economic consulting firm, jointly selected by the MSA parties, determined that the disadvantages of the MSA were a significant factor contributing to the participating manufacturers' collective loss of market share for each of the years 2003 - 2005.  A different independent economic consulting firm, jointly selected by the MSA parties, determined that the disadvantages of the MSA were a significant factor contributing to the participating manufacturers' collective loss of market share for the year 2006.  Following the firm's determination for 2006, the OPMs and the states agreed that the states would not contest that the disadvantages of the MSA were a significant factor contributing to the participating manufacturers' collective loss of market share for the years 2007, 2008 and 2009.  Accordingly, the OPMs and the states have agreed that no "significant factor" determination by an independent economic consulting firm will be necessary with respect to the participating manufacturers' collective loss of market share for the years 2007, 2008 and 2009 (the "significant factor agreement").  This agreement became effective for 2007, 2008 and 2009 on February 1, 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively.  The OPMs and the states have agreed to extend the significant factor agreement to apply to the participating manufacturers' collective loss of market share for 2010 and 2011, as well as to any collective loss of market share that the participating manufacturers experience for 2012.  This agreement will become effective for 2010 on February 1, 2013 and for 2011 on February 1, 2014.  If the MSA's Independent Auditor determines that the participating manufacturers collectively lost market share for 2012, this agreement will become effective for 2012 on February 1, 2015.
Following the "significant factor" determination with respect to 2003, 38 states filed declaratory judgment actions in state courts seeking a declaration that the state diligently
enforced its escrow statute during 2003.  The OPMs and other MSA-participating manufacturers responded to these actions by filing motions to compel arbitration in accordance with the terms of the MSA, including filing motions to compel arbitration in 11 MSA states and territories that did not file declaratory judgment actions.  Courts in all but one of the 46 MSA states and the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have ruled that the question of whether a state diligently enforced its escrow statute during 2003 is subject to arbitration.  Several of these rulings may be subject to further review.  The Montana state courts have ruled that the diligent enforcement claims of that state may be litigated in state court, rather than in arbitration.  In June 2012, following the denial of the OPMs' petition to the United States Supreme Court for a
writ of certiorari
, the participating manufacturers and Montana entered into a consent decree pursuant to which Montana will not be subject to the 2003 NPM Adjustment.
PM USA, the other OPMs and approximately 25 other MSA-participating manufacturers have entered into an agreement regarding arbitration with 45 MSA states and territories concerning the 2003 NPM Adjustment, including the states' claims of diligent enforcement for 2003.  The agreement further provides for a partial liability reduction for the 2003 NPM Adjustment for states that entered into the agreement by January 30, 2009 and are determined in the arbitration not to have diligently enforced a qualifying escrow statute during 2003.  Based on the number of states that entered into the agreement by January 30, 2009 (45), the partial liability reduction for those states is
20%
.  The partial liability reduction would reduce the amount of PM USA's 2003 NPM Adjustment by up to a corresponding percentage.  The selection of the arbitration panel for the 2003 NPM Adjustment was completed in July 2010, and the arbitration is currently ongoing.  Following the completion of discovery, the participating manufacturers determined to continue to contest the 2003 diligent enforcement claims of 33 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico and to no longer contest such claims by 12 states and four U.S. territories (the "non-contested states").  As a result, the non-contested states will not be subject to the 2003 NPM Adjustment, and their share of any such NPM Adjustment, along with the shares of any states found by the arbitration panel to have diligently enforced during 2003, will be reallocated in accordance with the MSA to those states, if any, found by the panel not to have diligently enforced during 2003.  Proceedings to determine state diligent enforcement claims for the years 2004 through 2011 have not yet been scheduled.
Once a significant factor determination in favor of the participating manufacturers for a particular year has been made by an economic consulting firm, or the states' agreement not to contest significant factor for a particular year has become effective, PM USA has the right under the MSA to pay the disputed amount of the NPM Adjustment for that year into a disputed payments account ("DPA") or withhold it altogether.  PM USA has made its full MSA payment due in

each year from 2006 - 2010 to the states (subject to a right to recoup the NPM Adjustment amount in the form of a credit against future MSA payments), even though it had the right to deduct the disputed amounts of the 2003 - 2007 NPM Adjustments, as described above, from such MSA payments.  PM USA paid its share of the amount of the disputed 2008 and 2009 NPM Adjustments shown below into the DPA in connection with its MSA payments due in 2011 and 2012, respectively.  The approximate maximum principal amounts
of PM USA's share of the disputed NPM Adjustment for the years 2003 through 2011, as currently calculated by the MSA's Independent Auditor, are as follows (the amounts shown below do not include the interest or earnings thereon to which PM USA believes it would be entitled in the manner provided in the MSA and do not reflect the partial liability reduction for the 2003 NPM Adjustment pursuant to the arbitration agreement described above):

17
MSA states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico for settlement of the 2003 - 2012 NPM Adjustments with those states and territories (the "signatory States").  The Term Sheet is subject to approval by the arbitration panel in the pending NPM Adjustment arbitration, which could come in the form of a stipulated award.  While it is possible that additional MSA states may subsequently join the Term Sheet, states that have not joined the Term Sheet (the "non-signatory States") have raised potential objections concerning the Term Sheet with the arbitration panel.  Also, a number of non-signatory States have indicated that they may attempt to take action in state court to prevent the settlement from proceeding or to seek other relief with respect to the settlement.  No assurance can be given that the arbitration panel will issue the order necessary for the Term Sheet to proceed or that the objections or any other such actions by non-signatory States will be resolved in a manner favorable to PM USA.  PM USA continues to reserve all rights regarding the NPM Adjustments with respect to the non-signatory States.
Under the Term Sheet, the OPMs will receive reductions to future MSA payments in an amount equal to
46%
of the signatory States' aggregate allocable share of the OPMs' aggregate 2003 - 2012 NPM Adjustments.  The OPMs have agreed that, subject to certain conditions, PM USA will receive approximately
28%
of such reduction (which is the maximum percentage allocation of the total 2003 - 2012 NPM Adjustments to which PM USA was entitled under the MSA); R.J. Reynolds will receive approximately 60% of such reductions; and Lorillard will receive approximately 12% of such reductions.  Based on the identity of the current signatory States and an estimate of the 2012 NPM Adjustment, PM USA expects to receive a reduction in its MSA payment obligation of approximately
$450 million
.  This estimated amount is subject to change depending on a variety of factors related to the calculation of the reductions.  If the Term Sheet proceeds, PM USA would record the amount as a corresponding increase in its reported pre-tax earnings.
Subject to certain conditions, PM USA expects to receive all of its reduction under the Term Sheet through a credit against its April 2013 MSA payment.  R.J. Reynolds and Lorillard are expected to receive part of their reductions through credits against their April 2013 MSA payments and part through reductions in their MSA payments in April 2014 - April 2017.
As part of the settlement, each of the signatory States will receive its portion of over
$4 billion
from the DPA.  In this context, PM USA will authorize release to the signatory States of their allocable share of the
$458 million
that PM USA has paid into the DPA (plus the accumulated earnings thereon), which amounts to approximately
$190 million
.
The Term Sheet also provides that the NPM Adjustment provision will be revised and streamlined as to the signatory States for years after 2012.  In connection with the settlement, the formula for allocating among the OPMs the revised NPM Adjustments applicable in the future to the signatory States will be modified in a manner favorable to PM USA, although the extent to which it is favorable to PM USA will be dependent upon certain future events, including the future relative market shares of the OPMs.
Except to the extent that a settlement under the Term Sheet proceeds and except with respect to the non-contested non-signatory States in regard to the 2003 NPM Adjustment, PM USA intends to pursue vigorously the disputed NPM Adjustments for 2003 - 2011 through the arbitration proceedings described above.  If the Term Sheet proceeds, the maximum principal amounts of PM USA's share of the disputed NPM Adjustments for 2003 - 2012 set forth in the table above are subject to being reduced to reflect the settlement under the Term Sheet in a manner to be determined.  PM USA believes that such determination would be made as part of the arbitration proceedings, but some non-signatory States have indicated that they may take the position that the determination would be made by state courts.  In addition, the amounts in such table may be recalculated by the MSA's Independent Auditor if it receives information that is different from or in addition to the information on which it based these

calculations, including, among other things, if it receives revised sales volumes from any participating manufacturer.  Disputes among the manufacturers could also reduce the foregoing amounts.  The availability and the precise amount of any NPM Adjustment for 2003 - 2011 obtained through such proceedings (as opposed to the settlement) will not be finally determined until 2013 or thereafter.  There is no certainty that the OPMs and other MSA-participating manufacturers would ultimately receive any adjustment as a result of these proceedings, and the amount of any adjustment received for a year could be less than the amount for that year listed above.  If the OPMs do receive such an adjustment through these proceedings (apart from the Term Sheet), the adjustment would be allocated among the OPMs pursuant to the MSA's provisions.  It is expected that PM USA would receive its share of any adjustments for 2003 - 2007 in the form of a credit against future MSA payments and its share of any adjustment for 2008 or 2009 in the form of a withdrawal from the DPA.
▪
Other Disputes Related to MSA Payments:
In addition to the disputed NPM Adjustments described above, MSA states and participating manufacturers, including PM USA, are conducting another arbitration to resolve certain other disputes related to the calculation of the participating manufacturers' payments under the MSA.  PM USA disputes the method by which ounces of "roll your own" tobacco have been converted to cigarettes for purposes of calculating the downward volume adjustments to its MSA payments.  PM USA believes that, for the years 2004 − 2012, the use of an incorrect conversion method resulted in excess MSA payments by PM USA in those years of approximately
$92 million
in the aggregate.  If PM USA prevails on this issue, it would be entitled to a credit against future MSA payments in that amount, plus interest.  In addition, PM USA seeks application of what it believes to be the correct method for payments to be made in years subsequent to 2012.
This arbitration will also resolve a dispute concerning whether the total domestic cigarette market and certain other calculations related to the participating manufacturers' MSA payments should be determined based on the "net" number of cigarettes on which federal excise tax is paid, as is currently the case, or whether the "adjusted gross" number of cigarettes on which federal excise tax is paid is the correct methodology.  PM USA does not have sufficient information at this time to determine the aggregate impact on its MSA payments that would result from a change from the "net" to the "adjusted gross" methodology.
This arbitration proceeding concluded on December 13, 2012, but the panel has not issued a ruling.  No assurance can be given that PM USA will prevail in this arbitration.
▪
Other MSA-Related Litigation:
Without naming PM USA or any other private party as a defendant, NPMs and/or their distributors or customers have filed several legal challenges to the MSA and related legislation.  New York state officials and the Attorneys General of a number of other states were defendants in a lawsuit (
King,
formerly
Pryor
) filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in which plaintiffs
alleged that the MSA and/or related legislation violated federal antitrust laws and the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.  In March 2011, the trial court granted summary judgment on all claims for the New York state officials.  Plaintiffs appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  In June 2012, the Second Circuit dismissed that appeal pursuant to a stipulation of the parties, concluding the litigation.
In addition to the
King
decision above, the United States Courts of Appeals for the Second, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, Ninth and Tenth Circuits have affirmed dismissals or grants of summary judgment in favor of state officials in seven other cases asserting antitrust and constitutional challenges to the allocable share amendment legislation in those states.
In January 2011, an international arbitration tribunal rejected claims brought against the United States challenging MSA-related legislation in various states under the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Federal Government's Lawsuit
In
1999
, the United States government filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against various cigarette manufacturers, including PM USA, and others, including Altria Group, Inc., asserting claims under three federal statutes, namely the Medical Care Recovery Act ("MCRA"), the MSP provisions of the Social Security Act and the civil provisions of RICO.  Trial of the case ended in June 2005.  The lawsuit sought to recover an unspecified amount of health care costs for tobacco-related illnesses allegedly caused by defendants' fraudulent and tortious conduct and paid for by the government under various federal health care programs, including Medicare, military and veterans' health benefits programs, and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.  The complaint alleged that such costs total more than
$20 billion
annually.  It also sought what it alleged to be equitable and declaratory relief, including disgorgement of profits that arose from defendants' allegedly tortious conduct, an injunction prohibiting certain actions by the defendants, and a declaration that the defendants are liable for the federal government's future costs of providing health care resulting from defendants' alleged past tortious and wrongful conduct.  In September 2000, the trial court dismissed the government's MCRA and MSP claims, but permitted discovery to proceed on the government's claims for relief under the civil provisions of RICO.
The government alleged that disgorgement by defendants of approximately
$280 billion
is an appropriate remedy.  In May 2004, the trial court issued an order denying defendants' motion for partial summary judgment limiting the disgorgement remedy.  In February 2005, a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that disgorgement is not a remedy available to the government under the civil provisions of RICO and entered summary judgment in favor of defendants with respect to the disgorgement claim.  In July 2005, the government petitioned
84

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
_________________________
the United States Supreme Court for further review of the Court of Appeals' ruling that disgorgement is not an available remedy, and in October 2005, the Supreme Court denied the petition.
In
June 2005
, the government filed with the trial court its proposed final judgment seeking remedies of approximately
$14 billion
, including
$10 billion
over a five-year period to fund a national smoking cessation program and
$4 billion
over a 10-year period to fund a public education and counter-marketing campaign.  Further, the government's proposed remedy would have required defendants to pay additional monies to these programs if targeted reductions in the smoking rate of those under 21 were not achieved according to a prescribed timetable.  The government's proposed remedies also included a series of measures and restrictions applicable to cigarette business operations, including, but not limited to, restrictions on advertising and marketing, potential measures with respect to certain price promotional activities and research and development, disclosure requirements for certain confidential data and implementation of a monitoring system with potential broad powers over cigarette operations.
In
August 2006
, the federal trial court entered judgment in favor of the government.  The court held that certain defendants, including Altria Group, Inc. and PM USA, violated RICO and engaged in seven of the eight "sub-schemes" to defraud that the government had alleged.  Specifically, the court found that:
▪
defendants falsely denied, distorted and minimized the significant adverse health consequences of smoking;
▪
defendants hid from the public that cigarette smoking and nicotine are addictive;
▪
defendants falsely denied that they control the level of nicotine delivered to create and sustain addiction;
▪
defendants falsely marketed and promoted "low tar/light" cigarettes as less harmful than full-flavor cigarettes;
▪
defendants falsely denied that they intentionally marketed to youth;
▪
defendants publicly and falsely denied that ETS is hazardous to non-smokers; and
▪
defendants suppressed scientific research.
The court did not impose monetary penalties on the defendants, but ordered the following relief: (i) an injunction against "committing any act of racketeering" relating to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion, health consequences or sale of cigarettes in the United States; (ii) an injunction against participating directly or indirectly in the management or control of the Council for Tobacco Research, the Tobacco Institute, or the Center for Indoor Air Research, or any successor or affiliated entities of each; (iii) an injunction against "making, or causing to be made in any way, any
material false, misleading, or deceptive statement or representation or engaging in any public relations or marketing endeavor that is disseminated to the United States public and that misrepresents or suppresses information concerning cigarettes"; (iv) an injunction against conveying any express or implied health message through use of descriptors on cigarette packaging or in cigarette advertising or promotional material, including "lights," "ultra lights" and "low tar," which the court found could cause consumers to believe one cigarette brand is less hazardous than another brand; (v) the issuance of "corrective statements" in various media regarding the adverse health effects of smoking, the addictiveness of smoking and nicotine, the lack of any significant health benefit from smoking "low tar" or "light" cigarettes, defendants' manipulation of cigarette design to ensure optimum nicotine delivery and the adverse health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke; (vi) the disclosure on defendants' public document websites and in the Minnesota document repository of all documents produced to the government in the lawsuit or produced in any future court or administrative action concerning smoking and health until 2021, with certain additional requirements as to documents withheld from production under a claim of privilege or confidentiality; (vii) the disclosure of disaggregated marketing data to the government in the same form and on the same schedule as defendants now follow in disclosing such data to the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") for a period of ten years; (viii) certain restrictions on the sale or transfer by defendants of any cigarette brands, brand names, formulas or cigarette businesses within the United States; and (ix) payment of the government's costs in bringing the action.
The defendants appealed and, in May 2009, a three judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a
per curiam
decision largely affirming the trial court's judgment against defendants and in favor of the government.  Although the panel largely affirmed the remedial order that was issued by the trial court, it vacated the following aspects of the order:
▪
its application to defendants' subsidiaries;
▪
the prohibition on the use of express or implied health messages or health descriptors, but only to the extent of extraterritorial application;
▪
its point-of-sale display provisions; and
▪
its application to Brown & Williamson Holdings.
The Court of Appeals panel remanded the case for the trial court to reconsider these four aspects of the injunction and to reformulate its remedial order accordingly.
Furthermore, the Court of Appeals panel rejected all of the government's and intervenors' cross appeal arguments and refused to broaden the remedial order entered by the trial court.  The Court of Appeals panel also left undisturbed its prior holding that the government cannot obtain disgorgement as a permissible remedy under RICO.

In July 2009, defendants filed petitions for a rehearing before the panel and for a rehearing by the entire Court of Appeals.  Defendants also filed a motion to vacate portions of the trial court's judgment on the grounds of mootness because of the passage of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act ("FSPTCA"), granting the United States Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") broad authority over the regulation of tobacco products.  In September 2009, the Court of Appeals entered three
per curiam
rulings.  Two of them denied defendants' petitions for panel rehearing or for rehearing
en banc
.  In the third
per curiam
decision, the Court of Appeals denied defendants' suggestion of mootness and motion for partial
vacatur
.  In February 2010, PM USA and Altria Group, Inc. filed their
certiorari
petitions with the United States Supreme Court.  In addition, the federal government and the intervenors filed their own
certiorari
petitions, asking the court to reverse an earlier Court of Appeals decision and hold that civil RICO allows the trial court to order disgorgement as well as other equitable relief, such as smoking cessation remedies, designed to redress continuing consequences of prior RICO violations.  In June 2010, the United States Supreme Court denied all of the parties' petitions.  In July 2010, the Court of Appeals issued its mandate lifting the stay of the trial court's judgment and remanding the case to the trial court.  As a result of the mandate, except for those matters remanded to the trial court for further proceedings, defendants are now subject to the injunction discussed above and the other elements of the trial court's judgment.
In February 2011, the government submitted its proposed corrective statements and the trial court referred issues relating to a document repository to a special master.  The defendants filed a response to the government's proposed corrective statements and filed a motion to vacate the trial court's injunction in light of the FSPTCA, which motion was denied in June 2011.  The defendants appealed the trial court's ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  On July 27, 2012, the Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's denial of the defendants' motion to vacate the district court's injunction.
Remaining issues pending include:  (i) the specifics relating to the court-ordered corrective statements and (ii) the requirements related to point-of-sale signage.  On November 27, 2012, the district court issued its order specifying the content of the corrective statements described above.  The district court's order requires that the parties engage in negotiations with the special master regarding implementation of the corrective statements remedy, which negotiations are to conclude by March 2013.  Unresolved issues will be decided by the special master and the court.  The defendants filed a notice of appeal from the corrective statements order on January 25, 2013 and a motion to hold the notice of appeal in abeyance on January 30, 2013.
In
December 2011
, the parties to the lawsuit entered into an agreement as to the issues concerning the document
repository.  Pursuant to this agreement, PM USA agreed to deposit an amount of approximately
$3.1 million
into the district court in installments over a
five
-year period.
"Lights/Ultra Lights" Cases
▪
Overview:
Plaintiffs in certain pending matters seek certification of their cases as class actions and allege, among other things, that the uses of the terms "Lights" and/or "Ultra Lights" constitute deceptive and unfair trade practices, common law or statutory fraud, unjust enrichment or breach of warranty, and seek injunctive and equitable relief, including restitution and, in certain cases, punitive damages.  These class actions have been brought against PM USA and, in certain instances, Altria Group, Inc. or its subsidiaries, on behalf of individuals who purchased and consumed various brands of cigarettes, including
Marlboro
Lights,
Marlboro
Ultra Lights,
Virginia Slims
Lights and Superslims,
Merit
Lights and
Cambridge
Lights.  Defenses raised in these cases include lack of misrepresentation, lack of causation, injury and damages, the statute of limitations, non-liability under state statutory provisions exempting conduct that complies with federal regulatory directives, and the First Amendment.  As of December 31, 2012, a total of
14
such cases were pending in the United States.
Three
of these cases were pending in U.S. federal courts as discussed below.  The other cases were pending in various U.S. state courts.  In addition, a purported "Lights" class action is pending against PM USA in Israel.
In the one "Lights" case pending in Israel (
El-Roy
), hearings on plaintiffs' motion for class certification were held in November and December 2008, and an additional hearing on class certification was held in November 2011.  On
November 28, 2012
, the trial court denied the plaintiffs' motion for class certification and ordered the plaintiffs to pay the defendants approximately
$100,000
in attorney fees.  Plaintiffs in that case have noticed an appeal.  See
Guarantees and Other Similar Matters
below for a discussion of the Distribution Agreement between Altria Group, Inc. and PMI that provides for indemnities for certain liabilities concerning tobacco products.
▪
The Good Case:
In May 2006, a federal trial court in Maine granted PM USA's motion for summary judgment in
Good
, a purported "Lights" class action, on the grounds that plaintiffs' claims are preempted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act ("FCLAA") and dismissed the case.  In December 2008, the United States Supreme Court ruled that plaintiffs' claims are not barred by federal preemption.  Although the Court rejected the argument that the FTC's actions were so extensive with respect to the descriptors that the state law claims were barred as a matter of federal law, the Court's decision was limited: it did not address the ultimate merits of plaintiffs' claim, the viability of the action as a class action, or other state law issues.  The case was returned to the federal court in Maine and consolidated with other federal cases in the multidistrict litigation

proceeding discussed below.  In June 2011, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice after the district court denied plaintiffs' motion for class certification, concluding the litigation.
▪
Federal Multidistrict Proceeding and Subsequent Developments:
Since the December 2008 United States Supreme Court decision in
Good
, and through December 31, 2012,
24
purported "Lights" class actions were served upon PM USA and, in certain cases, Altria Group, Inc.  These cases were filed in 14 states, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia.  All of these cases either were filed in federal court or were removed to federal court by PM USA and were transferred and consolidated by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ("JPMDL") before the United States District Court for the District of Maine for pretrial proceedings ("MDL proceeding").
In
November 2010
, the district court in the MDL proceeding denied plaintiffs' motion for class certification in
four
cases, covering the jurisdictions of California, the District of Columbia, Illinois and Maine.  These jurisdictions were selected by the parties as sample cases, with two selected by plaintiffs and two selected by defendants.  Plaintiffs sought appellate review of this decision but, in February 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit denied plaintiffs' petition for leave to appeal.  Later that year, plaintiffs in
13
cases voluntarily dismissed without prejudice their cases.  In April 2012, the JPMDL remanded the remaining four cases (
Phillips, Tang, Wyatt
and
Cabbat
) back to the federal district courts in which the suits originated.  In
Tang,
which was pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice in July 2012, concluding the litigation.
In
Phillips
, which is now pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, defendants filed in June 2012 a motion for partial judgment on the pleadings on plaintiffs' class action consumer sales practices claims and a motion for judgment on the pleadings on plaintiffs' state deceptive trade practices claims.  A hearing on plaintiff's motion for class certification currently is set for August 30, 2013.
In
Cabbat
, which is pending in the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii, plaintiffs in July 2012 amended their complaint, adding a claim for unjust enrichment and dropping their claims for breach of express and implied warranty.
In
Wyatt
, which is pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification on January 11, 2013.
▪
"Lights" Cases Dismissed, Not Certified or Ordered De-Certified:
To date, in addition to the district court in the MDL proceeding, 16 courts in
17
"Lights" cases have refused to certify class actions, dismissed class action allegations,
reversed prior class certification decisions or have entered judgment in favor of PM USA.
Trial courts in Arizona, Illinois, Kansas, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Tennessee and Washington have refused to grant class certification or have dismissed plaintiffs' class action allegations.  Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed a case in Michigan after a trial court dismissed the claims plaintiffs asserted under the Michigan Unfair Trade and Consumer Protection Act.
Several appellate courts have issued rulings that either affirmed rulings in favor of Altria Group, Inc. and/or PM USA or reversed rulings entered in favor of plaintiffs.  In Florida, an intermediate appellate court overturned an order by a trial court that granted class certification in
Hines
.  The Florida Supreme Court denied review in January 2008.  The Supreme Court of Illinois has overturned a judgment that awarded damages to a certified class in the
Price
case.  See
The Price Case
below for further discussion.  In Louisiana, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit dismissed a purported "Lights" class action brought in Louisiana federal court (
Sullivan
) on the grounds that plaintiffs' claims were preempted by the FCLAA.  In New York, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned a decision by a New York trial court in
Schwab
that granted plaintiffs' motion for certification of a nationwide class of all United States residents that purchased cigarettes in the United States that were labeled "Light" or "Lights." In July 2010, plaintiffs in
Schwab
voluntarily dismissed the case with prejudice.  In Ohio, the Ohio Supreme Court overturned class certifications in the
Marrone
and
Phillips
cases.  Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed without prejudice both cases in August 2009, but refiled in federal court (discussed above).  The Supreme Court of Washington denied a motion for interlocutory review filed by the plaintiffs in the
Davies
case that sought review of an order by the trial court that refused to certify a class.  Plaintiffs subsequently voluntarily dismissed the
Davies
case with prejudice.  In August 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the Illinois federal district court's dismissal of "Lights" claims brought against PM USA in the
Cleary
case.  In
Curtis
, a certified class action, in May 2012, the Minnesota Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's entry of summary judgment in favor of PM USA, concluding this litigation.
In
Lawrence
, in August 2012, the New Hampshire Supreme Court reversed the trial court's order to certify a class and subsequently denied plaintiffs' rehearing petition.  On October 26, 2012, the case was dismissed after plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss the case with prejudice, concluding this litigation.
In Oregon (
Pearson
), a state court denied plaintiff's motion for interlocutory review of the trial court's refusal to certify a class.  In February 2007, PM USA filed a motion for summary judgment based on federal preemption and the Oregon statutory exemption.  In September 2007, the district
87

court granted PM USA's motion based on express preemption under the FCLAA, and plaintiffs appealed this dismissal and the class certification denial to the Oregon Court of Appeals.  Argument was held in April 2010.
Other Developments
In December 2009, the state trial court in the
Carroll
(formerly known as
Holmes
) case (pending in Delaware) denied PM USA's motion for summary judgment based on an exemption provision in the Delaware Consumer Fraud Act.  In January 2011, the trial court allowed the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint substituting class representatives and naming Altria Group, Inc. and PMI as additional defendants.  In July 2011, the parties stipulated to the dismissal without prejudice of Altria Group, Inc. and PMI.  The stipulation is signed by the parties but not yet approved by the trial court.  See
Guarantees and Other Similar Matters
below for a discussion of the Distribution Agreement between Altria Group, Inc. and PMI that provides for indemnities for certain liabilities concerning tobacco products.
In June 2007, the United States Supreme Court reversed the lower court rulings in the
Miner
(formerly known as
Watson
) case that denied plaintiffs' motion to have the case heard in a state, as opposed to federal, trial court.  The Supreme Court rejected defendants' contention that the case must be tried in federal court under the "federal officer" statute.  The case was removed to federal court in Arkansas and the case was transferred to the MDL proceeding discussed above.  In November 2010, the district court in the MDL proceeding remanded the case to Arkansas state court.  In December 2011, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims against Altria Group, Inc. without prejudice.  A class certification hearing is set to begin on October 22, 2013.
▪
The Price Case:
Trial in the
Price
case commenced in state court in Illinois in January 2003, and in
March 2003
, the judge found in favor of the plaintiff class and awarded
$7.1 billion
in compensatory damages and
$3 billion
in punitive damages against PM USA.  In
December 2005
, the Illinois Supreme Court reversed the trial court's judgment in favor of the plaintiffs.  In November 2006, the United States Supreme Court denied plaintiffs' petition for
writ of certiorari
and, in
December 2006
, the Circuit Court of Madison County enforced the Illinois Supreme Court's mandate and dismissed the case with prejudice.
In December 2008, plaintiffs filed with the trial court a petition for relief from the final judgment that was entered in favor of PM USA.  Specifically, plaintiffs sought to vacate the judgment entered by the trial court on remand from the 2005 Illinois Supreme Court decision overturning the verdict on the ground that the United States Supreme Court's December 2008 decision in
Good
demonstrated that the Illinois Supreme Court's decision was "inaccurate." PM USA filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs' petition and, in February 2009, the trial court granted PM USA's motion on the basis that the petition was not timely filed.  In March 2009, the
Price
plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the Fifth Judicial District of the Appellate Court of Illinois.  In February 2011, the intermediate appellate court ruled that the petition was timely filed and reversed the trial court's dismissal of the plaintiffs' petition and, in September 2011, the Illinois Supreme Court declined PM USA's petition for review.  As a result, the case was returned to the trial court for proceedings on whether the court should grant the plaintiffs' petition to reopen the prior judgment.  In February 2012, plaintiffs filed an amended petition, which PM USA opposed.  Subsequently, in responding to PM USA's opposition to the amended petition, plaintiffs asked the trial court to reinstate the original judgment.  The trial court denied plaintiffs' petition on December 12, 2012.  On January 8, 2013, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the Fifth Judicial District.  On January 16, 2013, PM USA filed a motion asking the Illinois Supreme Court to immediately exercise its jurisdiction over the appeal.
In June 2009, the plaintiff in an individual smoker lawsuit (
Kelly
) brought on behalf of an alleged smoker of "Lights" cigarettes in Madison County, Illinois state court filed a motion seeking a declaration that his claims under the Illinois Consumer Fraud Act are not (i) barred by the exemption in that statute based on his assertion that the Illinois Supreme Court's decision in
Price
is no longer good law in light of the decisions by the United States Supreme Court in
Good
and
Watson
, and (ii) preempted in light of the United States Supreme Court's decision in
Good
.  In September 2009, the court granted plaintiff's motion as to federal preemption, but denied it with respect to the state statutory exemption.
▪
State Trial Court Class Certifications:
State trial courts have certified classes against PM USA in several jurisdictions.  Over time, several such cases have been dismissed by the courts at the summary judgment stage.  Certified class actions remain pending in California (
Brown
), Massachusetts (
Aspinall
) and Missouri (
Larsen
).  Significant developments in these cases include:
▪
Aspinall
:  In August 2004, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court affirmed the class certification order.  In August 2006, the trial court denied PM USA's motion for summary judgment and granted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on the defenses of federal preemption and a state law exemption to Massachusetts' consumer protection statute.  On motion of the parties, the trial court subsequently reported its decision to deny summary judgment to the appeals court for review and stayed further proceedings pending completion of the appellate review.  In December 2008, subsequent to the United States Supreme Court's decision in
Good
, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court issued an order requesting that the parties advise the court within 30 days whether the
Good
decision is dispositive of federal preemption issues pending on appeal.  In January 2009, PM USA notified the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial

Court that
Good
is dispositive of the federal preemption issues on appeal, but requested further briefing on the state law statutory exemption issue.  In March 2009, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court affirmed the order denying summary judgment to PM USA and granting the plaintiffs' cross-motion.  In January 2010, plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment as to liability claiming collateral estoppel from the findings in the case brought by the Department of Justice (see
Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - Federal Government's Lawsuit
described above).  In March 2012, the trial court denied plaintiffs' motion.
▪
Brown
:  In May 2009, the California Supreme Court reversed the trial court decision decertifying the class and remanded the case to the trial court.  At this time, the sole remaining theory of liability in this action is whether the marketing of "Lights" cigarettes was deceptive to consumers.  In September 2012, at the plaintiffs' request, the trial court dismissed all defendants except PM USA from the lawsuit.  Trial is currently scheduled for April 19, 2013.
▪
Larsen
:  In August 2005, a Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed the class certification order.  In December 2009, the trial court denied plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration of the period during which potential class members can qualify to become part of the class.  The class period remains 1995 through 2003.  In June 2010, PM USA's motion for partial summary judgment regarding plaintiffs' request for punitive damages was denied.  In April 2010, plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment as to an element of liability in the case, claiming collateral estoppel from the findings in the case brought by the Department of Justice (see
Federal Government's Lawsuit
described above).  The plaintiffs' motion was denied in December 2010.  In June 2011, PM USA filed various summary judgment motions challenging the plaintiffs' claims.  In August 2011, the trial court granted PM USA's motion for partial summary judgment, ruling that plaintiffs could not present a damages claim based on allegations that
Marlboro
Lights are more dangerous than
Marlboro
Reds.  The trial court denied PM USA's remaining summary judgment motions.  Trial in the case began in September 2011 and, in October 2011 the court declared a mistrial after the jury failed to reach a verdict.  The court has continued the new trial through January 2014, with an exact date to be determined.
Certain Other Tobacco-Related Litigation
▪
Tobacco Price Case:
One case remains pending in Kansas (
Smith
) in which plaintiffs allege that defendants, including PM USA and Altria Group, Inc., conspired to fix cigarette prices in violation of antitrust laws.  Plaintiffs' motion for class certification was granted.  In March 2012, the trial court granted defendants' motions for summary
judgment.  Plaintiffs sought the trial court's reconsideration of its decision, but in June 2012, the trial court denied plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration.  Plaintiffs have appealed the decision, and the defendants have cross-appealed the trial court's class certification decision, to the Court of Appeals of Kansas.
▪
Ignition Propensity Cases:
PM USA is currently facing litigation alleging that a fire caused by cigarettes led to individuals' deaths.  In a Kentucky case (
Walker
), the federal district court denied plaintiffs' motion to remand the case to state court and dismissed plaintiffs' claims in February 2009.  Plaintiffs subsequently filed a notice of appeal.  In October 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the portion of the district court decision that denied remand of the case to Kentucky state court and remanded the case to Kentucky state court.  The Sixth Circuit did not address the merits of the district court's dismissal order.  Defendants' petition for rehearing with the Sixth Circuit was denied in December 2011.
▪
False Claims Act Case:
PM USA is a defendant in a
qui tam
action filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (
United States ex rel. Anthony Oliver
) alleging violation of the False Claims Act in connection with sales of cigarettes to the U.S. military.  The relator contends that PM USA violated "most favored customer" provisions in government contracts and regulations by selling cigarettes to non-military customers in overseas markets at more favorable prices than it sold to the U.S. military exchange services for resale on overseas military bases in those same markets.  The relator has dropped Altria Group, Inc. as a defendant and has dropped claims related to post-MSA price increases on cigarettes sold to the U.S. military.  In July 2012, PM USA filed a motion to dismiss.
▪
Argentine Grower Cases:
PM USA and Altria Group, Inc. were named as defendants in
three
cases (
Hupan, Chalanuk
and
Rodriguez Da Silva)
filed in Delaware state court against multiple defendants by the parents of minor Argentine children born with alleged birth defects.  Plaintiffs in these cases allege that they grew tobacco in Argentina under contract with Tabacos Norte S.A., an alleged subsidiary of PMI, and that they and their infant children were exposed directly and
in utero
to hazardous herbicides and pesticides used in the production and cultivation of tobacco.  Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages against all defendants under U.S. and Argentine law.  Altria Group, Inc. and PM USA are in discussions with PMI regarding indemnification for these cases pursuant to the Distribution Agreement between Altria Group, Inc. and PMI.  See
Guarantees and Other Similar Matters
below for a discussion of the Distribution Agreement.  Discussion with other defendants regarding indemnification are also ongoing.  On December 11, 2012, Altria Group, Inc. and certain other defendants were dismissed from the cases.  The three

remaining defendants are PM USA, Philip Morris Global Brands (a subsidiary of PMI) and Monsanto Company.
UST Litigation
Claims related to smokeless tobacco products generally fall within the following categories:
First, UST and/or its tobacco subsidiaries has been named in certain actions in West Virginia (See
In re: Tobacco Litigation
above) brought by or on behalf of individual plaintiffs against cigarette manufacturers, smokeless tobacco manufacturers, and other organizations seeking damages and other relief in connection with injuries allegedly sustained as a result of tobacco usage, including smokeless tobacco products.  Included among the plaintiffs are five individuals alleging use of USSTC's smokeless tobacco products and alleging the types of injuries claimed to be associated with the use of smokeless tobacco products.  USSTC, along with other non-cigarette manufacturers, has remained severed from such proceedings since December 2001.
Second, UST and/or its tobacco subsidiaries has been named in a number of other individual tobacco and health suits over time.  Plaintiffs' allegations of liability in these cases are based on various theories of recovery, such as negligence, strict liability, fraud, misrepresentation, design defect, failure to warn, breach of implied warranty, addiction, and breach of consumer protection statutes.  Plaintiffs seek various forms of relief, including compensatory and punitive damages, and certain equitable relief, including but not limited to disgorgement.  Defenses raised in these cases include lack of causation, assumption of the risk, comparative fault and/or contributory negligence, and statutes of limitations.  USSTC is currently named in one such action in Florida (
Vassallo
).
Certain Other Actions
▪
IRS Challenges to PMCC Leases:
As discussed in Note 7.
Finance Assets, net,
Note 14.
Income Taxes
and Note 15.
Segment Reporting
above, Altria Group, Inc. entered into the Closing Agreement with the IRS in May 2012 that conclusively resolved the federal income tax treatment for all prior and future tax years of LILO and SILO transactions entered into by PMCC.
Pursuant to the Closing Agreement, Altria Group, Inc. paid
$456 million
in federal income taxes and related estimated interest with respect to the 2000 through 2010 tax years in June 2012.  This payment is net of federal income taxes that Altria Group, Inc. paid on gains associated with sales of assets leased in the LILO and SILO transactions from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2011.  In addition, Altria Group, Inc. expects to pay approximately
$50 million
in state taxes and related estimated interest for the 2000 through 2010 tax years, of which
$28 million
was paid in 2012 with the balance expected to be paid in 2013.  The tax component of these payments represents an acceleration of federal and state income taxes that Altria Group, Inc. would have
otherwise paid over the lease terms of the LILO and SILO transactions.
The IRS disallowed the tax benefits pertaining to PMCC's LILO and SILO transactions for the 1996 through 2003 tax years and was expected to disallow such benefits for the 2004 through 2009 tax years.  Pursuant to the Closing Agreement, the IRS will not assess against Altria Group, Inc. any additional taxes or any penalties in any open tax year through the 2010 tax year related to the LILO and SILO transactions; nor will the IRS impose penalties with respect to any prior tax years.  Altria Group, Inc. did not claim tax benefits pertaining to the LILO and SILO transactions in the 2010 and 2011 tax years and, under the terms of the Closing Agreement, will not claim such benefits in future tax years.
In June 2011, Altria Group, Inc. recorded a one-time charge of
$627 million
against its reported earnings related to the tax treatment of the LILO and SILO transactions.  In quantifying this charge, Altria Group, Inc. was required to make assumptions regarding the timing and terms of a potential settlement of this matter with the IRS.  As a result of differences between those assumptions and the terms of the Closing Agreement, Altria Group, Inc. recorded a one-time net earnings benefit of
$68 million
during the second quarter of 2012 due primarily to lower than estimated interest expense on tax underpayments.
Pursuant to the Closing Agreement, Altria Group, Inc. also agreed to dismiss, with prejudice, the litigation in federal court related to the tax treatment of the LILO and SILO transactions and to relinquish its right to seek refunds for federal taxes and interest previously paid.  The court entered the order of dismissal in May 2012 and Altria Group, Inc. reduced both Other assets and tax liabilities on its condensed consolidated balance sheet by approximately
$750 million
, which represents the remaining amount of federal taxes and interest that Altria Group, Inc. previously paid and accounted for as deposits pending the outcome of the LILO and SILO dispute.
Altria Group, Inc. previously paid a total of approximately
$1.1 billion
(
$945 million
in 2010) in federal income taxes and interest with respect to the LILO and SILO transactions.  Altria Group, Inc. treated the amounts paid to the IRS as deposits for financial reporting purposes pending the ultimate outcomes of the litigation and did not include such amounts in the supplemental disclosure of cash paid for income taxes on the consolidated statements of cash flows in the years paid.  During the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, Altria Group, Inc. relinquished its right to seek refunds of the deposits and included approximately
$750 million
and
$362 million
, respectively, in the supplemental disclosure of cash paid for income taxes on the consolidated statements of cash flows.
▪
Kraft Thrift Plan Cases:
Four participants in the Kraft Foods Global, Inc. Thrift Plan ("Kraft Thrift Plan"), a defined contribution plan, filed a class action complaint (
George II
) on behalf of all participants and beneficiaries of the Kraft Thrift

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
_________________________
Plan in July 2008 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging breach of fiduciary duty under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA").  Named defendants in this action included Altria Corporate Services, Inc. (now Altria Client Services Inc.) and certain company committees that allegedly had a relationship to the Kraft Thrift Plan.  Plaintiffs requested, among other remedies, that defendants restore to the Kraft Thrift Plan all losses improperly incurred.  In August 2011, Altria Client Services Inc. and a company committee that allegedly had a relationship to the Kraft Thrift Plan were added as defendants in another class action previously brought by the same plaintiffs in 2006 (
George I
), in which plaintiffs allege defendants breached their fiduciary duties under ERISA by offering company stock funds in a unitized format and by allegedly overpaying for recordkeeping services.  In June 2012, the district court approved a court-approved class-wide settlement for
George I
and
George II
that does not require any payment by the Altria Group, Inc. defendants, concluding this litigation.
Environmental Regulation
Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (and former subsidiaries) are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise related to environmental protection, including, in the United States: The Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known as "Superfund"), which can impose joint and several liability on each responsible party.  Subsidiaries (and former subsidiaries) of Altria Group, Inc. are involved in several matters subjecting them to potential costs of remediation and natural resource damages under Superfund or other laws and regulations.  Altria Group, Inc.'s subsidiaries expect to continue to make capital and other expenditures in connection with environmental laws and regulations.
Altria Group, Inc. provides for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated.  Such accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change.  Other than those amounts, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the cost of any environmental remediation and compliance efforts that subsidiaries of Altria Group, Inc. may undertake in the future.  In the opinion of management, however, compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including the payment of any remediation costs or damages and the making of related expenditures, has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on Altria Group, Inc.'s consolidated results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position or cash flows.
Guarantees and Other Similar Matters
In the ordinary course of business, certain subsidiaries of
Altria Group, Inc. have agreed to indemnify a limited number of third parties in the event of future litigation.  At
December 31, 2012
, subsidiaries of Altria Group, Inc. were also contingently liable for
$31 million
of guarantees related to their own performance, consisting primarily of surety bonds.  In addition, from time to time, subsidiaries of Altria Group, Inc. issue lines of credit to affiliated entities.  These items have not had, and are not expected to have, a significant impact on Altria Group, Inc.'s liquidity.
Under the terms of a distribution agreement between Altria Group, Inc. and PMI (the "Distribution Agreement"), entered into as a result of Altria Group, Inc.'s 2008 spin-off of its former subsidiary PMI, liabilities concerning tobacco products will be allocated based in substantial part on the manufacturer.  PMI will indemnify Altria Group, Inc. and PM USA for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by PMI or contract manufactured for PMI by PM USA, and PM USA will indemnify PMI for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by PM USA, excluding tobacco products contract manufactured for PMI.  Altria Group, Inc. does not have a related liability recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at
December 31, 2012
as the fair value of this indemnification is insignificant.
As more fully discussed in Note 19.
Condensed Consolidating Financial Information
, PM USA has issued guarantees relating to Altria Group, Inc.'s obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program.
Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest
In September 2007, Ste. Michelle completed the acquisition of Stag's Leap Wine Cellars through one of its consolidated subsidiaries, Michelle-Antinori, LLC ("Michelle-Antinori"), in which Ste. Michelle holds an
85%
ownership interest with a
15%
noncontrolling interest held by Antinori California ("Antinori").  In connection with the acquisition of Stag's Leap Wine Cellars, Ste. Michelle entered into a put arrangement with Antinori.  The put arrangement, as later amended, provides Antinori with the right to require Ste. Michelle to purchase its 15% ownership interest in Michelle-Antinori at a price equal to Antinori's initial investment of
$27 million
.  The put arrangement became exercisable on September 11, 2010 and has no expiration date.  As of
December 31, 2012
, the redemption value of the put arrangement did not exceed the noncontrolling interest balance.  Therefore, no adjustment to the value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest was recognized on the consolidated balance sheet for the put arrangement.
The noncontrolling interest put arrangement is accounted for as mandatorily redeemable securities because redemption is outside of the control of Ste. Michelle.  As such, the redeemable noncontrolling interest is reported in the mezzanine equity section on the consolidated balance sheets at
December 31, 2012
and 2011.

_________________________
Note 19.  Condensed Consolidating Financial Information
PM USA, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc., has issued guarantees relating to Altria Group, Inc.'s obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program (the "Guarantees").  Pursuant to the Guarantees, PM USA fully and unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor, the payment and performance of Altria Group, Inc.'s obligations under the guaranteed debt instruments (the "Obligations"), subject to release under certain customary circumstances as noted below.
The Guarantees provide that PM USA guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of the Obligations.  The liability of PM USA under the Guarantees is absolute and unconditional irrespective of: any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations; or any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, Altria Group, Inc. or PM USA.
The obligations of PM USA under the Guarantees are limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of PM USA that are relevant under Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the Guarantees, result in PM USA's obligations under the Guarantees not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.  For this purpose, "Bankruptcy Law" means Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors.
PM USA will be unconditionally released and discharged from the Obligations upon the earliest to occur of:
▪
the date, if any, on which PM USA consolidates with or merges into Altria Group, Inc. or any successor;
▪
the date, if any, on which Altria Group, Inc. or any successor consolidates with or merges into PM USA;
▪
the payment in full of the Obligations pertaining to such Guarantees; and
▪
the rating of Altria Group, Inc.'s long-term senior unsecured debt by Standard & Poor's of A or higher.
At
December 31, 2012
, the respective principal wholly-owned subsidiaries of Altria Group, Inc. and PM USA were not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their common stock.
The following sets forth the condensed consolidating balance sheets as of
December 31, 2012
and
2011
, condensed consolidating statements of earnings and comprehensive earnings for the years ended
December 31, 2012
,
2011
and
2010
, and condensed consolidating statements of cash flows for the years ended
December 31, 2012
,
2011
and
2010
for Altria Group, Inc., PM USA and Altria Group, Inc.'s other subsidiaries that are not guarantors of Altria Group, Inc.'s debt instruments (the "Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries").  The financial information is based on Altria Group, Inc.'s understanding of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") interpretation and application of Rule 3-10 of SEC Regulation S-X.
The financial information may not necessarily be indicative of results of operations or financial position had PM USA and the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries operated as independent entities. Altria Group, Inc. and PM USA account for investments in their subsidiaries under the equity method of accounting.
Certain prior-period amounts have been recast to conform with the current-period presentation, due to Middleton becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of PM USA effective January 1, 2012.
Beginning in the second quarter of 2012, Altria Group, Inc. revised the classification of cash dividends received from subsidiaries on its condensed consolidating statements of cash flows to present them as cash flows from operating activities.  These amounts were previously classified as cash flows from financing activities.  As other prior period financial information is presented, Altria Group, Inc. will similarly revise the condensed consolidating statements of cash flows in its future filings.  The impact of this revision, which Altria Group, Inc. determined is not material to the related financial statements, is to increase cash inflows from operating activities (and decrease cash inflows from financing activities) for Altria Group, Inc. and PM USA as follows:

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of Altria Group, Inc.:
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, stockholders' equity, and cash flows, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also in our opinion, Altria Group, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  Altria Group, Inc.’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on Altria Group, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Management On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management of Altria Group, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Altria Group, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Internal control over financial reporting includes those written policies and procedures that:
n
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Altria Group, Inc.;
n
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America;
n
provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of Altria Group, Inc. are being made only in accordance with the authorization of management and directors of Altria Group, Inc.; and
n
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Internal control over financial reporting includes the controls themselves, monitoring and internal auditing practices and actions taken to correct deficiencies as identified.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of Altria Group, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012.  Management based this assessment on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in "
Internal Control — Integrated Framework"
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management's assessment included an evaluation of the design of Altria Group, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting.  Management reviewed the results of its assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
Based on this assessment, management determined that, as of December 31, 2012, Altria Group, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, who audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of Altria Group, Inc. included in this report, has audited the effectiveness of Altria Group, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, as stated in their report herein.
