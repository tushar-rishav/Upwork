>Suggestions to improve the solution to decide if a person should be allowed to board the ship.
 
 * Currently the factors considered are limited to:
 	* Name
 	* Health
 	* Intelligence
 	* Economic Output

 	We should also consider other factors like person's profession and sex.
 	Having a population that has sufficient doctors, farmers, engineers and a balanced
 	Sex ratio is very important for the growth of human species. So we should also consider such factors.

 * We should also improve the conditions within available factors. For example, someone who has a very
   high health level but less economic output should be allowed to board the ship as the person is going to live longer and hence contribute to the community for long/ Someone who has very high
   Intelligence but poor health level is also not going to be very contributing to the community.
   So, based on these ideas, we should further improve the condition check.	 

>Suggestions to improve the inventory management.

 * Include more varieties in food. May include Ham, beef etc.
 * Include foods that would last longer and require less storage/maintainence cost.

>Description of how to use external hardware and access to the internet to improve the programs developed in Task 1 and Task 2

 * We can program a raspberry pi to do these things:
 	* Fire an alarm whenever a person is trying to feed again.
 	* Take a snapshot of person once he is fed and display it online.
 	* Update the food availability in real time and warn the manager whenever a particular stock is about to finish. That'd certainly reduce the number person in unfed.
 	* We can also monitor the stock using the video controller which is capable of standard modern TV resolutions, such as HD and Full HD, and higher or lower monitor resolutions and older standard CRT TV resolutions. This would help in catching if anyone tries to steal the food.
 		* Going a step further, in case of burgarly, we can also identify the person by processing the person's image and matching with the database and fire and alarm or display online the detail of person who was involved in such act.
